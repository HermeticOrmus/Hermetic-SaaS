# Knowledge Base Builder

## Overview

The Knowledge Base Builder transforms individual launch learnings into institutional knowledge. Every success, failure, optimization, and discovery is systematically documented, categorized, and made searchable—compounding the collective wisdom of all HermeticSaaS builders.

**Philosophy**: Knowledge that isn't codified is knowledge lost. The framework should remember what individuals forget.

## Building the Knowledge Base

### Data Sources

1. **Launch Retrospectives**
   - Extract learnings from each retrospective
   - Identify patterns across multiple launches
   - Tag issues and solutions

2. **Community Contributions**
   - Accept knowledge submissions
   - Peer review for accuracy
   - Merge into canonical documentation

3. **External Research**
   - Monitor tech blogs and papers
   - Track framework updates
   - Follow security advisories

4. **Automated Analysis**
   - Pattern extraction from code
   - Issue clustering and categorization
   - Trend detection

### Content Curation Process

```
Discovery → Documentation → Review → Categorization → Publication → Maintenance
```

1. **Discovery**: Identify a pattern, failure, or optimization
2. **Documentation**: Fill out the appropriate template
3. **Review**: Peer review by experienced builders
4. **Categorization**: Tag and place in correct category
5. **Publication**: Add to searchable knowledge base
6. **Maintenance**: Update as new information emerges

### Quality Standards

Every knowledge base entry must:
- Be based on real-world evidence
- Include code examples
- Provide actionable steps
- Link to related entries
- Include metrics/impact data
- Be kept up-to-date

### Search & Discovery

```typescript
// Knowledge base search interface
interface KnowledgeSearch {
  query: string;
  category?: Category;
  severity?: Severity;
  complexity?: Complexity;
  tags?: string[];
}

// Example searches:
// "stripe webhook verification"
// "next.js build optimization"
// "authentication failure modes"
```

### Contribution Workflow

1. **Submit Entry**
   ```bash
   npm run kb:submit --template=failure-mode
   ```

2. **Peer Review**
   - Accuracy verification
   - Completeness check
   - Code testing

3. **Approval**
   - Maintainer review
   - Merge to knowledge base
   - Credit contributor

4. **Propagation**
   - Update related templates
   - Notify relevant builders
   - Add to changelog

## Metrics & Growth

### Knowledge Base Health

- **Total Entries**: [Count]
- **Entries Added This Month**: [Count]
- **Average Entry Quality**: [Score]
- **Search Queries Per Day**: [Count]
- **Query Success Rate**: [Percentage]

### Most Valuable Entries

Ranked by:
- Search frequency
- Referenced in launches
- Time saved estimates
- Community votes

### Coverage Gaps

Areas needing more documentation:
- [Topic with few entries]
- [Emerging technology]
- [Common questions without answers]

## Integration with Framework

### Template Generation
Knowledge base entries automatically improve templates:
- Failure modes → Add preventive checks
- Success patterns → Create reusable templates
- Optimizations → Update defaults

### Contextual Help
Framework CLI provides contextual KB articles:
```bash
$ hermetic deploy
⚠️  Detected potential issue: Missing environment variables
📚 See: knowledge-base/failure-modes/deployment/env-vars-missing.md
```

### Learning Paths
Curated paths through knowledge base:
- "First-time launcher path"
- "Authentication deep dive"
- "Performance optimization journey"

## Evolution & Maintenance

### Regular Reviews
- **Monthly**: Review most-searched entries for updates
- **Quarterly**: Audit for outdated information
- **Yearly**: Major reorganization if needed

### Deprecation
- Mark outdated entries as deprecated
- Provide migration to current approach
- Maintain for historical reference

### Versioning
- Track KB version alongside framework version
- Major KB updates noted in releases
- Migration guides for breaking knowledge changes

## Success Criteria

The knowledge base is successful when:
- Time to solve common issues < 5 minutes
- New builders ship faster than experienced ones did historically
- Community contributes > 50% of new entries
- Search success rate > 90%
- Zero repeated failures across launches

---

**Remember**: The knowledge base is the memory of the framework. Every learning captured prevents the next builder from making the same mistake. Every success pattern documented accelerates the next launch. The framework that remembers is the framework that compounds.
