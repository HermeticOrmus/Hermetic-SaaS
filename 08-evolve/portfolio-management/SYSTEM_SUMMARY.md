## Key Metrics & Formulas

### Portfolio-Level Metrics
```
Total MRR = Σ(product MRR)
Weighted Growth Rate = Σ(product growth × product MRR share)
Portfolio Health = Σ(product health × product MRR share)

Diversification Score = 1 - ((HHI - 1/n) / (1 - 1/n))
where HHI = Σ(revenue_share²)

Concentration Risk:
- Low: HHI < 0.25
- Medium: HHI 0.25-0.50
- High: HHI > 0.50
```

### Product Health Scoring
```
Overall Health =
  Revenue Health × 0.25 +
  Growth Health × 0.25 +
  Retention Health × 0.20 +
  Efficiency Health × 0.15 +
  Technical Health × 0.15

Categories:
- Excellent: ≥80
- Good: ≥60
- Fair: ≥40
- Poor: <40
```

### Opportunity Cost
```
Opportunity Cost = (Potential ROI - Current ROI) × Hours Invested

Current ROI = MRR / (hours per week × 4.33)
```

### Valuation
```
Base Valuation = ARR × Multiple

Multiple Factors:
Base: 4x (stable SaaS)
+ Growth (>15% MRR): +0.5 to +2x
+ Low Maintenance (<5h/week): +0.5x
- High Churn (>7%): -0.5 to -1x
- Tech Debt: -0.5 to -1x
```

## Decision Frameworks

### Four Strategies Matrix
```
                High Growth
                    |
            INVEST  |  OPTIMIZE
                    |
Low MRR ————————————+———————————— High MRR
                    |
            DECIDE  |  MAINTAIN
                    |
                Low Growth
```

**Actions**:
- INVEST: Increase time & marketing (6-12 months)
- OPTIMIZE: Scale ops, hire help, maximize growth
- MAINTAIN: Minimize time (<10h/week), harvest cash
- DECIDE: Pivot, sell, or shut down (3 months)

### Time Allocation (70-20-10 Rule)
- 70% → Primary product (growth focus)
- 20% → Secondary product (maintenance/opportunity)
- 10% → Experiments (validation)

### When to Start Product #2
- [ ] Product #1 >$5K MRR
- [ ] Operations <10 hours/week
- [ ] Growth is predictable
- [ ] Validated acquisition playbook
- [ ] Still excited about building

## Usage Examples

### Track Portfolio Health
```typescript

const metrics = calculatePortfolioMetrics(products);
console.log(`Portfolio MRR: $${metrics.totalMRR}`);
console.log(`Health Score: ${metrics.portfolioHealthScore}/100`);
console.log(`Diversification: ${metrics.diversificationScore}`);
```

### Calculate Product Health
```typescript
import { calculateProductHealth, getRecommendation } from './product-health-scorer';

const health = calculateProductHealth(product);
const rec = getRecommendation(product);

console.log(`Health: ${health.overall}/100`);
console.log(`Strategy: ${rec.strategy}`);
console.log(`Action: ${rec.primaryAction}`);
```

### Optimize Resource Allocation
```typescript
import { optimizeResourceAllocation } from './portfolio-analytics';

const allocation = optimizeResourceAllocation(products, 40); // 40 hours/week

allocation.recommendations.forEach(rec => {
  console.log(`${rec.product}: ${rec.currentHours}h → ${rec.recommendedHours}h`);
  console.log(`Reason: ${rec.rationale}`);
});
```

### Single Sign-On
```typescript
import { PortfolioAuthService } from './multi-product-infrastructure';

const auth = new PortfolioAuthService(jwtSecret, db);

// User logs in once
const { user, accessToken } = await auth.login(email, password);

// Gets access to all subscribed products
const hasAccess = await auth.hasProductAccess(user.id, 'product_a');
```

## Integration Guide

### 1. Set Up Dashboard
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install react recharts tailwindcss

# Add portfolio dashboard to your app
cp portfolio-dashboard.tsx src/components/

# Import in your app
import PortfolioDashboard from './components/portfolio-dashboard';
```

### 2. Implement Analytics
```typescript
// Initialize analytics service
import { PortfolioAnalyticsService } from './portfolio-analytics';

const analytics = new PortfolioAnalyticsService(db);

// Track events from all products
await analytics.track({
  userId: user.id,
  productId: 'product_a',
  event: 'feature_used',
  properties: { feature: 'export' }
});
```

### 3. Add Health Scoring
```typescript
// Run weekly health checks
import { calculateProductHealth, generateHealthAlerts } from './product-health-scorer';

products.forEach(product => {
  const health = calculateProductHealth(product);
  const alerts = generateHealthAlerts(product);

  if (alerts.some(a => a.severity === 'critical')) {
    // Send notification
    notifyFounder(product.name, alerts);
  }
});
```

### 4. Implement Shared Auth
```typescript
// Set up SSO across products
import { PortfolioAuthService } from './multi-product-infrastructure';

const auth = new PortfolioAuthService(
  process.env.JWT_SECRET,
  database
);

// Product A API
app.post('/api/action', async (req, res) => {
  const user = await auth.validateToken(req.headers.authorization);

  if (!await auth.hasProductAccess(user.id, 'product_a')) {
    return res.status(403).json({ error: 'No access' });
  }

  // Process request
});
```

## Success Metrics

Track these weekly/monthly:
- [ ] Portfolio MRR growth rate
- [ ] Diversification score (target: >0.5)
- [ ] Time ROI per product
- [ ] Number of cross-sells
- [ ] Portfolio health score (target: >70)

2. **Week 2**: Implement health scoring
3. **Week 3**: Calculate all metrics
4. **Week 4**: Run first portfolio review
5. **Month 2**: Optimize resource allocation
6. **Month 3**: Execute strategic decisions
