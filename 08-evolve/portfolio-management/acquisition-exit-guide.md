# Acquisition & Exit Guide for MicroSaaS

A comprehensive guide to preparing for, executing, and maximizing value from selling your MicroSaaS product.

## When to Consider Selling

### Good Reasons to Sell

**1. Strategic Opportunity**
- Receiving an offer significantly above market valuation (5-6x ARR)
- Acquisition allows product to reach potential you can't achieve alone
- Buyer has synergies that make product more valuable
- Strategic buyer offers premium for market position

**2. Portfolio Optimization**
- Product plateaued but still valuable (stable $3K+ MRR)
- Other opportunities have higher ROI potential
- Opportunity cost of maintaining is too high
- Want to focus resources on higher-growth products

**3. Personal Reasons**
- Burned out on the product or niche
- Life circumstances changing (new job, family, relocation)
- Want to pursue different opportunities
- Need liquidity for other investments

**4. Market Timing**
- Market multiples are favorable
- Industry consolidation happening (buyers active)
- Before major platform changes that could hurt value
- Competitors getting funded (buyer interest high)

### Red Flags (Don't Sell If...)

- Product is growing >20% MRR monthly (unless exceptional offer)
- You just figured out the growth formula
- Churn is decreasing and metrics improving
- You're selling due to temporary frustration
- Offer is below 3x ARR without good reason
- You haven't tried to optimize first

## Valuation Fundamentals

### Typical MicroSaaS Valuations

**Standard Multiples:**
```
Bootstrapped SaaS (no VC): 3-5x ARR
- Lower end (3x): Mature, slow growth, higher churn
- Middle (4x): Stable, modest growth, good metrics
- Higher end (5x): Strong growth, excellent metrics

Premium Deals (5-8x ARR):
- Exceptional growth (>30% MRR monthly)
- Very low churn (<3% monthly)
- Highly automated, low maintenance
- Strategic value to buyer
- Multiple acquisition offers (bidding war)

Below Market (<3x ARR):
- Declining revenue
- High churn (>8%)
- Significant tech debt
- Platform dependency risk
- Owner-dependent operations
```

### Valuation Factors

**Positive Multipliers:**
- ✅ Recurring revenue (SaaS model)
- ✅ Low churn (<5% monthly)
- ✅ High gross margins (>80%)
- ✅ Automated operations
- ✅ Diversified customer base
- ✅ Growth trajectory
- ✅ Clean code, good documentation
- ✅ Proprietary technology or data
- ✅ Strong brand/market position

**Negative Multipliers:**
- ❌ One-time revenue (not recurring)
- ❌ High churn (>8%)
- ❌ Revenue concentration (top 3 customers >50%)
- ❌ Platform dependency (e.g., Shopify app with no alternative)
- ❌ Owner-dependent (only you can run it)
- ❌ Technical debt
- ❌ Declining metrics
- ❌ Legal/compliance issues

### Calculating Your Valuation

**Step 1: Calculate ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)**
```
ARR = MRR × 12

Example:
- MRR: $5,000
- ARR: $60,000
```

**Step 2: Determine Base Multiple**
```
Start with 4x for stable SaaS
Adjust based on factors:

Growth: +0.5x to +2x (if growing >15% monthly)
Churn: -0.5x to -1x (if >7% monthly)
Automation: +0.5x (if <5 hours/week)
Tech Debt: -0.5x to -1x (if significant)
Market: +0.5x to +1x (if hot market/strategic)

Example:
Base: 4x
Growth (+15% MRR): +0.5x
Low maintenance: +0.5x
Final Multiple: 5x
```

**Step 3: Calculate Valuation**
```
Valuation = ARR × Final Multiple

Example:
$60,000 ARR × 5x = $300,000 valuation
```

### Valuation Examples

**Example 1: High-Growth Product**
```
MRR: $8,000
ARR: $96,000
Growth: 25% monthly
Churn: 3%
Time: 8 hours/week
Multiple: 5.5x

Valuation: $528,000
```

**Example 2: Stable Cash Cow**
```
MRR: $12,000
ARR: $144,000
Growth: 2% monthly
Churn: 5%
Time: 4 hours/week
Multiple: 4.5x

Valuation: $648,000
```

**Example 3: Declining Product**
```
MRR: $3,000
ARR: $36,000
Growth: -3% monthly
Churn: 9%
Time: 15 hours/week
Multiple: 2.5x

Valuation: $90,000
```

- Filters out lowball buyers

**Know Your Walk-Away Price**
- Minimum acceptable offer
- Based on opportunity cost
- Consider tax implications

### Common Negotiation Points

**1. Price**
- Multiple of ARR
- Earnout components
- Payment structure

**2. Terms**
- All cash vs payment plan
- Earnout periods (avoid if possible)
- Non-compete terms
- Escrow arrangements

**3. Transition**
- Support period (30-90 days typical)
- Knowledge transfer
- Customer introductions
- Ongoing consulting (charge separately)

### Red Flags in Buyers

**Avoid Buyers Who:**
- Won't sign NDA before seeing details
- Ask for free trial period
- Want extended earnouts (>6 months)
- Can't prove funds/financing
- Are vague about their background
- Rush you without proper diligence
- Want to change deal terms constantly
- Won't communicate clearly

**Green Flags in Buyers:**

## Deal Structures

### All-Cash Deal (Preferred)
```
Buyer pays 100% at closing
- Cleanest exit
- No ongoing risk
- May get slightly lower price
- Typical for smaller deals (<$500K)
```

### Cash + Earnout
```
Example:
- 70% cash at closing: $210K
- 30% earnout over 6 months: $90K
  (if MRR maintained)

Pros: Higher total valuation
Cons: Risk, ongoing involvement
```

### Seller Financing
```
Example:
- 50% down: $150K
- 50% over 12 months: $150K + 5% interest

Pros: Attracts more buyers
Cons: Risk of non-payment
```

### Asset Sale vs Stock Sale

**Asset Sale (Most Common for MicroSaaS):**
- Buyer purchases specific assets
- Seller retains liability for past issues
- Cleaner for both parties
- Tax implications vary by jurisdiction

**Stock Sale (Rare for MicroSaaS):**
- Buyer purchases entire company
- All liabilities transfer
- More complex, usually larger deals

## Tax Considerations

**Consult a Tax Professional - This is Not Tax Advice**

### General Tax Treatment (US)

**Long-Term Capital Gains (If held >1 year)**
- 0%, 15%, or 20% federal tax
- Depends on income level
- Significant savings vs ordinary income

**Ordinary Income**
- For assets held <1 year
- Or portion of sale treated as ordinary income
- Higher tax rate (up to 37% federal)

**State Taxes**
- Vary by state (0% to 13.3%)
- Some states have no capital gains tax

**Example Tax Calculation (Simplified):**
```
Sale Price: $300,000
Cost Basis: $10,000 (what you invested)
Capital Gain: $290,000

Federal Tax (20%): $58,000
State Tax (5%): $14,500
Total Tax: $72,500

Net Proceeds: $227,500
```

### Tax Optimization Strategies

**1. Timing**
- Hold >1 year for long-term capital gains
- Consider spreading sale across tax years
- Be aware of your overall tax situation

**2. Structure**
- Allocate portions to different asset types
- Consider installment sales
- Explore Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) if applicable

**3. Expenses**
- Deduct broker fees
- Deduct legal/accounting costs
- Track all sale-related expenses
