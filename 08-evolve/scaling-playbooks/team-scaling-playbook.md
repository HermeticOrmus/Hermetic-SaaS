# Team Scaling Playbook: From Solo to Team

> "The right hire at the right time can 10x your business. The wrong hire at the wrong time can kill it." - Startup Reality

## The Hiring Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Automate Before You Hire**
   - Every hire should be because automation can't solve it
   - Spend $1K on tools before hiring a $50K person
   - If a process isn't documented, you can't hire for it

2. **Hire for Gaps, Not Growth**
   - Don't hire because you're growing
   - Hire because you have a specific bottleneck
   - Revenue per employee should increase, not decrease

3. **Contractor First, Employee Second**
   - Start every role as contractor (3 months)
   - Test fit before commitment
   - Easier to scale up or down
   - Less risk, faster iteration

4. **Remote from Day One**
   - Global talent pool
   - Lower costs
   - Async-first culture
   - Better work-life balance

## When to Hire Your First Person

### The Decision Framework

**DON'T hire when:**
- MRR <$10K (you can't afford sustainable salary)
- Churn >10% (fix product first)
- You're personally working <60 hours/week (capacity available)
- The problem can be automated or outsourced
- You don't have clear 6-month runway for salary

**DO hire when:**
- Specific bottleneck identified
- Bottleneck preventing revenue growth
- You've tried automation/tools
- You have 12+ months runway for salary
- Role has clear success metrics

### The $10K MRR Rule

**At $10K MRR:**
- ~$5K profit margin (50%)
- Can afford ~$4K/month compensation
- $48K/year for first hire
- Contractor: $25-35/hour, part-time

**Math:**
```
$10K MRR
- $3K infrastructure/tools (30%)
- $2K founder salary (20%)
= $5K available for team

First hire: $3-4K/month
Remaining: $1-2K buffer
```

- If it solves 80%+: don't hire yet
- If it solves <50%: probably time to hire

**Example:**
```
Support work: 20 hours/week
Try: Intercom ($100/mo) + Help Scout ($50/mo)
Result: Reduces to 10 hours/week
Cost: $1,800/year vs $30K/year for hire
Decision: Use tools, delay hire
```

**Fix:**
- Written role description
- 30/60/90 day goals

- Clear success metrics
- Regular feedback

### 5. No Onboarding Process
**Symptom:** New hires unproductive for weeks

**Fix:**

**Remember:** The best hire is the one you don't need to make. Automate first, contract second, hire third.

Build a team that's small enough to stay nimble, large enough to execute, and profitable enough to sustain.

The goal isn't a big team. It's a effective team that ships great products for happy customers profitably.
