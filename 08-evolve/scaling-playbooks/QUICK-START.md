# Quick Start Guide: Scaling in 30 Days

> "The best time to prepare for scale was yesterday. The second best time is now."

## Your 30-Day Scaling Sprint

This guide helps you implement critical scaling foundations in just 30 days, regardless of your current stage.

---

## Week 1: Assessment & Foundation

### Day 1-2: Know Your Numbers

**Action Items:**
1. Open `scaling-calculator.tsx` and input your metrics
2. Take screenshot of projections
3. Document current metrics:
   ```
   Current Users: _______
   Current MRR: $_______
   Monthly Growth Rate: _______%
   Churn Rate: _______%
   ARPU: $_______
   Team Size: _______
   Revenue per Employee: $_______
   ```

4. Identify your stage (from README.md):
   - [ ] 0-100 users (Product-Market Fit)
   - [ ] 100-1K users (Channel Validation)
   - [ ] 1K-10K users (Operational Excellence)
   - [ ] 10K+ users (Platform Maturity)

**Deliverable:** One-page metrics snapshot

---

### Day 3-4: Identify Bottleneck

**Use this decision tree:**

```
High Churn (>7%)?
├─ YES → Bottleneck: Retention
│  └─ Read: product-scaling-framework.md
│  └─ Action: Fix onboarding, talk to churned users
│
└─ NO → Growth Stalling (<10% monthly)?
    ├─ YES → Bottleneck: Acquisition
    │  └─ Read: user-growth-strategies.md
    │  └─ Action: Pick ONE channel, go deep
    │
    └─ NO → Revenue per Employee Low (<$5K/mo)?
        ├─ YES → Bottleneck: Efficiency
        │  └─ Read: team-scaling-playbook.md
        │  └─ Action: Automate before hiring
        │
        └─ NO → Ready to Scale!
           └─ Read: technical-scaling-guide.md
           └─ Action: Infrastructure improvements
```

**Deliverable:** One primary bottleneck identified with action plan

---

### Day 5: Set 90-Day Goals

**Template:**
```markdown
## 90-Day Scaling Goals

**Primary Metric:**
- Current: _______
- Target: _______
- Required Growth: _______%

**Secondary Metrics:**
- Metric 1: _______ → _______
- Metric 2: _______ → _______

**Key Initiatives (Max 3):**
1. _______________________________
2. _______________________________
3. _______________________________

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Primary metric hit
- [ ] No increase in churn
- [ ] Team not burned out
```

**Deliverable:** 90-day goals document shared with team

---

## Week 2: Technical Foundation

### Day 6-7: Monitoring Setup

**If you have NONE of these, you're flying blind:**

**Essential Monitoring (pick ONE tool per category):**

1. **Uptime Monitoring:**
   ```
   - BetterStack (recommended)
   - UptimeRobot
   - Pingdom

   Setup time: 30 minutes
   Cost: $0-20/month
   ```

2. **Error Tracking:**
   ```
   - Sentry (recommended)
   - Rollbar
   - Bugsnag

   Setup time: 1 hour
   Cost: $0-26/month
   ```

3. **Performance Monitoring:**
   ```
   - Your hosting dashboard (Railway, Render, etc.)
   - New Relic (if budget allows)

   Setup time: 30 minutes
   Cost: Included or $0-100/month
   ```

**Action:** Set up all three TODAY. No excuses.

**Deliverable:** Alerts configured, test alert received

---

### Day 8-9: Database Optimization

**Run this health check:**

```sql
-- Find missing indexes (PostgreSQL)
SELECT
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  attname,
  n_distinct,
  correlation
FROM pg_stats
WHERE schemaname NOT IN ('pg_catalog', 'information_schema')
  AND n_distinct > 100
  AND correlation < 0.1
ORDER BY n_distinct DESC;

-- Find slow queries (if pg_stat_statements enabled)
SELECT
  query,
  calls,
  total_exec_time,
  mean_exec_time,
  max_exec_time
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**For each slow query found:**
1. Add appropriate index
2. Test query performance
3. Deploy to production
4. Monitor improvement

**Quick Wins:**
- [ ] Index all foreign keys
- [ ] Add compound indexes for common queries
- [ ] Set up connection pooling (if not already)
- [ ] Enable query logging for slow queries (>1s)

**Deliverable:** 3+ indexes added, query performance improved

---

### Day 10-11: Caching Layer

**Implement Redis caching (if not already):**

**Priority 1: Session Storage**
```javascript
// Move sessions from database to Redis
// Result: 10-100x faster session lookups
// Impact: Faster page loads for logged-in users
```

**Priority 2: Database Query Caching**
```javascript
// Cache frequently accessed data
// Example: User profiles, configuration, public data
// TTL: 5-60 minutes depending on update frequency
```

**Priority 3: API Response Caching**
```javascript
// Cache API responses at edge (Cloudflare)
// Public endpoints: 1 hour+ cache
// Authenticated endpoints: 5-15 minutes cache
```

**Quick Implementation:**
1. Sign up for Upstash Redis (free tier)
2. Implement cache-aside pattern for 3 hottest queries
3. Add cache warming for critical data
4. Monitor cache hit rate (target >80%)

**Deliverable:** Redis caching for top 3 queries, >50% hit rate

---

### Day 12: Background Jobs

**Move these to background jobs if not already:**

**Must be async:**
- [ ] Email sending
- [ ] Report generation
- [ ] Image processing
- [ ] Data exports
- [ ] Third-party API calls

**Quick Setup (BullMQ):**
```bash
npm install bullmq ioredis
```

```javascript
// Create queue (5 minutes)
import { Queue } from 'bullmq';
const emailQueue = new Queue('emails');

// Add job (1 minute)
await emailQueue.add('welcome', { userId, email });

// Process job (10 minutes)
import { Worker } from 'bullmq';
const worker = new Worker('emails', async (job) => {
  await sendEmail(job.data.email);
});
```

**Deliverable:** Email sending moved to background jobs

---

## Week 3: Growth & Revenue

### Day 13-15: Pricing Optimization

**Quick Audit:**

1. **Compare to competitors:**
   - List top 3 competitors
   - Compare your pricing
   - Are you cheapest? (Red flag if yes)

2. **Calculate ideal price:**
   ```
   Current ARPU: $_______
   Target ARPU (2x current): $_______

   New pricing for NEW customers: $_______
   Grandfather existing: Yes / No
   ```

3. **Add annual plan if missing:**
   ```
   Current monthly: $______/mo
   Annual price: $______ (17% discount)
   Savings shown: $______/year
   ```

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Update pricing page
- [ ] Add annual toggle
- [ ] Grandfather existing users (optional)
- [ ] Announce price increase (7 days notice)

**Expected Impact:** 20-40% revenue increase within 60 days

**Deliverable:** New pricing live for new customers

---

### Day 16-17: Expansion Revenue

**Set up automated upgrade prompts:**

**Trigger 1: Usage Limits (Easiest)**
```javascript
// When user hits 80% of quota
showBanner({
  message: "You're using 80% of your quota",
  cta: "Upgrade Now",
  link: "/upgrade?source=usage_limit"
});

// Expected conversion: 20-40%
```

**Trigger 2: Feature Gating**
```javascript
// When user tries Pro feature
showModal({
  title: "This is a Pro feature",
  features: ["Feature 1", "Feature 2", "Feature 3"],
  cta: "Try Pro Free for 7 Days",
  link: "/upgrade?source=feature_gate"
});

// Expected conversion: 10-20%
```

**Deliverable:** 2 automated upgrade triggers implemented

---

### Day 18-19: Churn Reduction

**Implement Dunning Management:**

**The sequence:**
```
Day 0: Payment fails
  └─> Retry immediately (40% success)

Day 1: Email "Payment failed"
  └─> Retry payment (15% success)

Day 3: Email "Please update card"
  └─> Retry payment (10% success)

Day 7: Email "Final notice"
  └─> Retry payment (5% success)

Day 14: Downgrade to free OR cancel
```

**Use Stripe's:**
- Smart Retries (automatic)
- Email dunning (configure)
- Card Updater (enable)

**Expected Impact:** Recover 40-60% of failed payments

**Deliverable:** Dunning emails configured and tested
