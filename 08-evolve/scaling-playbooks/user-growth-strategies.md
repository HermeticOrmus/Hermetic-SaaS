# User Growth Strategies: 10x Your User Base

> "Don't find customers for your products, find products for your customers." - Seth Godin

## The 10x Growth Framework

### The Brutal Truth About Growth

Most SaaS companies never get past 100 users. Of those that do:
- 80% stall before 1,000 users
- 95% never reach 10,000 users
- 99% never reach 100,000 users

**Why?** They spread thin across many channels instead of dominating one.

### The One Channel Rule

**For 0-1K users:** Master ONE channel completely
**For 1K-10K users:** Add ONE more channel
**For 10K-100K users:** Optimize 2-3 core channels + experiments

### 6. Viral Loop Optimization

#### Designing for Virality

```
Viral Coefficient (K) = Users × Invites per User × Conversion Rate

K > 1 = Exponential growth (rare)

K = 0.2-0.5 = Good viral component
K < 0.2 = Not meaningfully viral
```

**How to Increase K:**

1. **Increase invite rate:**
   - Make inviting core to product value
   - Remove friction (one-click invite)
   - Incentivize both sides
   - Show social proof (who else joined)

2. **Increase conversion rate:**
   - Personalized invite messages
   - Show who invited them
   - Clear value proposition
   - Immediate activation

3. **Speed up cycle time:**
   - Real-time notifications
   - Immediate value from accepting
   - Reduce signup friction
   - Mobile optimization

#### Viral Mechanisms by Product Type

**Collaboration Tools (Slack, Figma):**
- Multi-user required for value
- Invite teammates → immediate value
- External sharing creates awareness
- Network effects compound

**Content Creation (Canva, Loom):**
- Shareable output
- "Made with X" branding
- Export gates (remove branding for paid)
- Templates and remixes

**Productivity Tools (Notion, Airtable):**
- Template galleries

**Remember:** Growth isn't about tactics. It's about finding the one thing that works for YOUR product and YOUR audience, then doing more of it.

Don't find customers for your product. Find products for your customers. Then tell them about it relentlessly.
