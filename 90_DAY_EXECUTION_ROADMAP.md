4. DM someone who's done it before
5. Hire freelancer on Upwork ($50-100 to unblock)

**Rule**: Don't stay stuck >4 hours. Get help.

### If Launch Fails
1. Don't panic
2. Collect feedback (why didn't it work?)
3. Iterate and relaunch in 7 days
4. Most "successful" products launched 2-3 times

**Rule**: Failure is data. Learn and adjust.

### If Revenue Misses Goal
1. Analyze funnel (where are people dropping?)
2. Talk to 10 customers (what made them buy?)
3. Talk to 10 non-customers (what stopped them?)
4. Fix biggest bottleneck
5. Double down on what's working

**Rule**: Revenue fixes are usually in messaging, not product.
