# Claude Orchestration Workflows

> **Automated agent chains for complete MicroSaaS execution**

This directory contains workflow definitions that chain Hermetic Agents together for complex, multi-phase operations. Each workflow represents a complete process from start to finish.

---

## ðŸŒŠ Workflow Philosophy

**Agent Chaining**: Complex tasks are broken down into agent-specific steps that flow seamlessly from one to another.

**Context Preservation**: Each agent receives context from previous agents to make informed decisions.

**Error Handling**: Workflows include fallback strategies and validation at each step.

**Parallel Execution**: Where possible, agents work in parallel to maximize speed.

```

```yaml
sequence:
  - agent: [Agent Name]
    role: [What they do]
    input: [What they receive]
    output: [What they produce]
    success_criteria: [When to proceed]
```

### 3. Execution Commands
```bash
# Example command formats
```

### 4. Error Handling
```yaml
error_handling:
  - condition: [Error condition]
    fallback: [Fallback agent/action]
```

## ðŸš€ Creating Custom Workflows

### Step 1: Define Your Process
Map out the complete process:
1. What's the goal?
2. What steps are needed?
3. Which agents handle which steps?
4. What's the output of each step?

### Step 2: Identify Agent Chain
Select agents based on their expertise:
- Discovery: Janus, Echo, Metis
- Architecture: Sol, Neptune
- Development: Iris, Jupiter, Uranus, Pallas
- Design: Venus, Hera, Eros, Titan
- Testing: Mars, Ganymede, Europa, Callisto
- Deployment: Ceres, Vulcan
- Marketing: Psyche, Eris, Fortuna, Calliope
- Operations: Hygeia, Chiron, Plutus

### Step 3: Define Handoffs
Specify what each agent passes to the next:
```yaml
Agent A output:
  - item_1
  - item_2

Agent B input (receives from Agent A):
  - item_1
  - item_2
```

### Step 4: Create Workflow File
Use the template: `.claude/workflows/WORKFLOW_TEMPLATE.md`

## ðŸ“Š Workflow Execution Patterns

### Sequential Execution
Agents execute one after another, each building on previous work:
```
A â†’ B â†’ C â†’ D
```

### Parallel Execution
Multiple agents work simultaneously:
```
     â†’ B â†’
A â†’  â†’ C â†’  â†’ E
     â†’ D â†’
```

### Conditional Execution
Workflow branches based on conditions:
```
      â†’ B â†’ D
A â†’
      â†’ C â†’ E
```

### Loop Execution
Agents iterate until success criteria met:
```
A â†’ B â†’ C â†’ [Check] â†’ [Pass: D] or [Fail: Back to B]
```

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Workflow Best Practices

### 1. Clear Inputs/Outputs
Every agent must have:
- Clear input requirements
- Defined output format
- Success criteria

### 2. Context Preservation
Pass context forward:
```yaml
agent_1_output:
  context:
    problem: "User authentication issues"
    goal: "Secure auth system"
    constraints: ["Must support OAuth", "Under $100/mo"]

agent_2_input:
  receives: agent_1_output.context
  uses: context to make decisions
```

### 3. Error Recovery
Plan for failures:
```yaml
if: Mars finds critical bugs
then: Loop back to Jupiter (feature dev)
else: Proceed to Callisto (analysis)
```

### 4. Validation Gates
Check quality at each stage:
```yaml
validation:
  - agent: Mars
    validates: Jupiter's code
    gate: "All tests pass"
    action_if_fail: "Return to Jupiter with issues"
```

## ðŸ”„ Workflow Iteration

### After Each Workflow Run

1. **Capture Learnings**
   - What worked well?
   - What was inefficient?
   - Which agents struggled?

2. **Update Workflows**
   - Refine agent prompts
   - Adjust sequence
   - Improve handoffs

3. **Optimize**
   - Identify parallel opportunities
   - Remove redundant steps
   - Speed up bottlenecks

## ðŸŽ® Using Workflows

### Method 1: Command Execution
```bash
/microsaas "Build an AI tool for phone anxiety practice"
```

### Method 2: Manual Agent Invocation
```bash
# Follow workflow manually
Janus, research phone anxiety app opportunities
Echo, analyze demand for phone practice tools
Metis, validate user needs for anxiety apps
# ... continue through workflow
```

### Method 3: Hybrid Approach
```bash
# Start automated
/discover "phone anxiety apps"

# Review results, then continue manually or automated
/build-microsaas "PhonePractice" "AI coach for phone anxiety"
```
