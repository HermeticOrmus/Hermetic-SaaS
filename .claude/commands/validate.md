Execute a rapid validation of a specific MicroSaaS idea using Hermetic principles.

**IDEA TO VALIDATE**: "{{args}}"

---

**STEP 1: DEMAND SIGNALS (Agent: Echo)**

Echo, quickly assess market demand for this idea:

1. Search for evidence of the problem across platforms:
   - Reddit discussions mentioning this pain point
   - Twitter/X complaints and requests
   - Product Hunt comments on similar tools
   - Google Trends search volume

2. Look for willingness-to-pay signals:
   - Existing paid solutions
   - User stated prices they'd pay
   - Competitor pricing acceptance
   - Pre-order / waitlist indicators

3. Assess problem severity:
   - Emotional language intensity
   - Frequency of mentions
   - Number of people affected
   - Current workaround complexity

Output: Quick demand assessment with confidence level (High/Medium/Low) and supporting evidence.

---

**STEP 2: COMPETITIVE CHECK (Agent: Prometheus)**

Prometheus, rapid competitive analysis:

1. Identify 5-10 main competitors (direct and indirect)
2. Quick feature comparison
3. Pricing range analysis
4. Identify the biggest gap or weakness in existing solutions
5. Assess: Is there room for a new player?

Output: Competitive snapshot with clear differentiation opportunity (or lack thereof).

---

**STEP 3: FEASIBILITY CHECK (Agent: Sol)**

Sol, assess technical feasibility:

1. What technology would be required?
2. Complexity level (Simple/Medium/Complex)
3. Estimated time to functional MVP
4. Any technical blockers or challenges?
5. Available tools/APIs to accelerate development

Output: Feasibility assessment with recommended approach.

**STEP 4: VIABILITY SCORE (Agent: Chronos)**

Chronos, provide rapid viability score:

Quick scoring (60 points total):
- **Demand Evidence** (20 points): Clear, quantified demand
- **Market Gap** (20 points): Weakness in existing solutions
- **Technical Feasibility** (20 points): Can build quickly

**Decision Threshold**:
- **40+ points**: Strong validation → Proceed to full /discover or start building
- **30-39 points**: Uncertain → Need deeper research
- **<30 points**: Weak validation → Pivot or abandon

---

**FINAL VALIDATION REPORT**:

Provide:
1. **Viability Score**: [X/60 points]
2. **Recommendation**: GO / MAYBE / NO-GO
3. **Key Evidence**: Top 3 data points supporting the decision
4. **Biggest Risk**: Primary concern or gap
5. **Next Step**:
   - If GO: Recommended action (full /discover, build prototype, etc.)
   - If MAYBE: What research is needed to decide
   - If NO-GO: Alternative pivot or new direction

**Hermetic Principle Check**:
- ✅ **Accurate**: Based on real data, not assumptions
- ✅ **Divine**: Genuinely solves a real problem
- ✅ **Functional**: Technically feasible
- ✅ **No Schemes**: Honest assessment

Keep the validation rapid but rigorous. Better to reject quickly than build the wrong thing.
