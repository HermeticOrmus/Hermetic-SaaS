# Pricing Frameworks for SaaS

**Pricing is your growth lever.** The right pricing strategy can 10x your revenue without changing your product.

## Core Principle: Price on Value, Not Cost

Your costs are irrelevant to pricing. Price based on:
1. **Value delivered** to the customer
2. **Willingness to pay** in your market segment
3. **Strategic positioning** vs competitors

## Quick Start

1. **Start with 3 tiers** - Free/Starter, Pro, Enterprise
2. **Anchor high** - Make your top tier 3-4x your middle tier
3. **Test often** - Pricing is never "done"
4. **Grandfather existing users** - Never surprise with price increases

## Real-World Benchmarks

### SaaS Pricing Tiers (Industry Averages)

**B2C SaaS:**
- Free: $0 (limited features)
- Pro: $9-29/month
- Premium: $49-99/month
- Conversion rate: 2-5% free to paid

**B2B SaaS (SMB):**
- Starter: $29-79/month
- Professional: $99-299/month
- Business: $499-999/month
- Conversion rate: 10-20% trial to paid

**B2B SaaS (Enterprise):**
- Professional: $500-2,000/month
- Enterprise: $5,000-50,000/month
- Conversion rate: 20-40% qualified leads

### Key Metrics

**Ideal Ratios:**
- Middle tier should capture 60% of customers
- 10-30% go premium (price anchoring works)
- LTV should be 3x CAC (minimum)
- Annual plans should be 2 months free (16% discount)

**Pricing Psychology:**
- Ending in 9 ($29, $99) increases conversions 8-12%
- Monthly toggle (vs yearly only) increases trials by 20%
- "Most Popular" badge on middle tier increases selection by 30%

## Common Pricing Mistakes

### 1. Pricing Too Low
**Mistake:** "We'll make it up in volume"
**Fix:** Double your prices. Seriously. If fewer than 20% of prospects complain about price, you're too cheap.

### 2. Too Many Tiers
**Mistake:** 5+ pricing tiers confuse customers
**Fix:** 3 tiers maximum. Free/Starter + Pro + Enterprise

### 3. Unclear Value Differentiation
**Mistake:** "Pro has more API calls" (who cares?)
**Fix:** "Pro removes bottlenecks for growing teams"

### 4. Feature-Based Instead of Value-Based
**Mistake:** Listing features per tier
**Fix:** Show outcomes: "Ship 3x faster" not "50 GB storage"

### 5. No Anchor Pricing
**Mistake:** Only showing one price
**Fix:** Show 3 options with middle highlighted
