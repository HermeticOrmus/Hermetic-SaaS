## The First 5 Minutes (Most Critical)

**60% of users who don't get value in first 5 minutes never come back.**

**Framework: "Aha Moment Sprint"**

1. **Identify your "Aha Moment"**
   - Slack: First message sent in a channel
   - Dropbox: First file uploaded and synced
   - Notion: First page created and shared
   - Your product: ___________________

2. **Measure time to "Aha Moment"**
   - Track time from signup to first value
   - Goal: < 5 minutes for 80% of users
   - Current average: _____ minutes

3. **Remove friction**
   - Skip: Email verification (do it later)
   - Skip: Profile completion (optional)
   - Skip: Feature tours (contextual instead)
   - Focus: Get to "Aha Moment" ASAP

## Key Principles

### 1. Show Value Before Asking for Value

```
❌ Bad Flow:
1. Signup form
2. Email verification
3. Profile completion
4. Feature tour
5. Finally see product

✅ Good Flow:
1. See product demo/preview
2. One-click signup (Google/GitHub)
3. Immediately create first project
4. Get "Aha Moment"
5. Then ask for profile info
```

### 2. Progressive Profiling

Don't ask for everything upfront. Collect data over time.

```javascript
// Signup: Email only
{ email }

// After first "Aha Moment": Role
{ role: 'developer' }

// When they hit free tier limit: Company size
{ company_size: '1-10' }

// Before upgrade: Payment info
{ payment_method }
```

### 3. Jobs-to-be-Done Segmentation

Understand why people use your product.

```
Example: Project Management Tool

Job 1: "I need to track my freelance projects"
→ Show: Simple kanban board
→ Upgrade trigger: When projects > 5

Job 2: "I need team collaboration"
→ Show: Team features first
→ Upgrade trigger: When users > 3

Job 3: "I need client reporting"
→ Show: Reporting features
→ Upgrade trigger: When clients > 2
```

Ask in onboarding: "What brings you here today?"

### 4. Time-Based Triggers

Not all users convert at the same time.

```
User Segments by Time-to-Convert:

Fast Converters (10%): 0-1 days
→ Give them easy upgrade path immediately
→ Show pricing on dashboard

Medium Converters (60%): 3-7 days
→ Email sequence showing value
→ In-app prompts when hitting limits

Slow Converters (25%): 14-30 days
→ Nurture with tips & case studies
→ Special offer at day 25

Never Convert (5%): 30+ days
→ Win-back campaign or move to free tier
```

## A/B Testing Framework

### What to Test

**High Impact:**
1. Headline on landing page
2. CTA button text and color
3. Pricing (amounts and structure)
4. Signup flow (fields required)
5. Trial length (7 vs 14 vs 30 days)

**Medium Impact:**
6. Social proof placement
7. Email subject lines
8. Onboarding checklist
9. Upgrade prompt timing
10. Payment page design

**Low Impact:**
- Button shape (rounded vs square)
- Color variations (both good)
- Footer links
- Minor copy changes

### Testing Rules

1. **One variable at a time**
   - Don't test headline + CTA simultaneously
   - Test headline first, then CTA

2. **Statistical significance**
   - Need ~100 conversions per variant minimum
   - 95% confidence level
   - Use calculator: abtestguide.com/calc/

3. **Test duration**
   - Run for at least 1 week (capture weekly patterns)
   - Don't stop early even if "winning"

4. **Sample size**
   ```
   Current conversion: 2%
   Expected improvement: 0.5% (to 2.5%)
   Significance: 95%
   Power: 80%

   Required sample: ~15,000 visitors per variant
   ```
