# Trial-to-Paid Email Sequences

**Goal:** Convert trial users to paying customers through strategic email communication.

**Benchmarks:**
- 14-day trial: 20-25% conversion rate
- 7-day trial: 15-20% conversion rate
- 30-day trial: 25-30% conversion rate

**Key Insight:** Users who experience your "Aha Moment" are 3-5x more likely to convert.

---

## Sequence Strategy

### Principles

1. **Education over selling** - Focus on helping them succeed
2. **Value first** - Share tips, case studies, best practices
3. **Urgency (ethical)** - Remind of trial ending, show what they'll lose
4. **Social proof** - Others like them are succeeding
5. **Low friction** - One-click upgrade path

### Timing

**Don't wait until day 13 to ask for the sale.**

Introduce pricing early (day 2-3) so it's not a surprise. Focus on value, then remind them to upgrade.

## Email Best Practices

### Subject Lines

**What works:**
- ✅ Clear and specific: "2 days left in your trial"
- ✅ Benefit-focused: "How to [achieve outcome]"
- ✅ Personal: "I noticed you [specific action]"
- ✅ Curiosity: "The feature most teams miss"

**What doesn't:**
- ❌ Generic: "Newsletter #4"
- ❌ Salesy: "BUY NOW - 50% OFF"
- ❌ Vague: "Important information"
- ❌ ALL CAPS or excessive punctuation!!!

### Email Length

- **Welcome:** 100-150 words (quick read)
- **Educational:** 150-200 words (enough for value)
- **Urgency:** 75-100 words (get to the point)
- **Trial ended:** 100-150 words (clear options)

### CTAs

- **One primary CTA** per email (button or link)
- **Button text:** Action-oriented ("Start my project", not "Click here")
- **Color:** High contrast, brand consistent
- **Placement:** Above and below fold for longer emails

### Sending Time

**B2B:**
- Best: Tuesday-Thursday, 10am-11am or 2pm-3pm
- Avoid: Monday mornings, Friday afternoons, weekends

**B2C:**
- Best: Evenings (6pm-8pm) or weekend mornings
- Test: Your audience may be different

## A/B Testing Ideas

2. **CTA button text**
   - "Upgrade now" vs "Continue with Pro" vs "Keep my data"

3. **Email timing**
   - Send Day 12 email on Day 11 vs Day 12 vs Day 13

4. **Sender name**
   - "John from [Product]" vs "[Product] Team" vs "John, CEO"

5. **Price mention timing**
   - Day 3 vs Day 7 vs Day 10

## Tools

**Email Service Providers:**
- Customer.io (best for SaaS, behavior-triggered)

- Mixpanel (user journey tracking)
- Amplitude (cohort analysis)
- PostHog (self-hosted option)

**Testing:**

## Template Usage

1. **Copy sequence above**
2. **Replace [brackets] with your product info**
3. **Adjust timing based on your trial length**
