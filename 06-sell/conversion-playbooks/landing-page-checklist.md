# Landing Page Optimization Checklist

**Your landing page is your #1 revenue driver.** A great landing page can 3-5x your conversion rate.

**Benchmark:** 30-40% visitor to signup conversion

---

## The 5-Second Test

**Can visitors answer these in 5 seconds?**

1. What is this?
2. Who is it for?
3. What do I get?
4. Why should I trust you?
5. What do I do next?

If not, your page fails.
