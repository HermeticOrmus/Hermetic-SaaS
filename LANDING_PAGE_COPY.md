```

---

## Section 3: Problem Agitation

### Headline
```
Building a MicroSaaS Shouldn't Take 6 Months of Your Life
```

### Problem List
```
You're a capable developer. You have great product ideas. But...

❌ You spend weeks rebuilding auth, payments, and analytics for every project
❌ You waste months trying to find ideas worth building
❌ You launch to crickets because you have no marketing strategy
❌ You're stuck in "tutorial hell" copying code from Stack Overflow
❌ You don't know if you should use Next.js, Django, or something else
❌ Your code quality is inconsistent across projects
❌ You have no idea how to scale past your first 100 users
❌ You're reinventing the wheel while competitors ship faster

Sound familiar?
```

### Agitation Paragraph
```
Here's the painful truth: Most developers spend 80% of their time on the
boring 20% (auth, payments, deployment) and only 20% of their time on
the valuable 80% (their unique product idea).

Meanwhile, successful founders have systems. They have templates. They have
playbooks. They ship in days while you're still deciding which database to use.

The gap isn't talent. It's tooling.
```

## Section 5: How It Works (3-Step Process)

### Headline
```
How to Launch Your First MicroSaaS in 7 Days
```

### Step 1: Discover a Validated Opportunity
```
[Icon: Magnifying glass]

Run the Reddit scraper across 12 subreddits to find real pain points.
Use the opportunity scorecard to rate ideas (BUILD / MAYBE / PASS).
Pick an idea that scores 8+ on all six Hermetic principles.

Example output:
"Problem: Designers struggle to manage client feedback on 47 different
 platforms. Mentioned 127 times in r/web_design, trending up 40%."

Time: 2 hours
```

### Step 2: Build Your MVP with AI Agents
```
[Icon: Code brackets]

Clone the Next.js SaaS template (auth, payments, analytics built-in).
Use the 38 AI agents to build your unique features:
  - Sol (architecture) plans your system
  - Jupiter (features) builds core functionality
  - Luna (code review) ensures quality
  - Venus (design) makes it beautiful

Example: "Sol, plan a feedback widget. Jupiter, implement it. Luna, review."

Time: 5 days
```

### Step 3: Launch and Scale with Playbooks
```
[Icon: Rocket]

Follow the Product Hunt launch playbook (step-by-step checklist).
Activate the TikTok viral strategy to get organic reach.
Use the $10K MRR playbook to optimize pricing and conversion.

Example: Launch on Tuesday at 12:01am PST, share in 12 communities,
         run Product Hunt ads for $50, hit #3 product of the day.

Time: Launch day + ongoing optimization
```

### The 38 AI Agents
```
🤖 Your Autonomous Development Team

CORE 7 PLANETARY AGENTS:
• Sol (Sun) - System Architecture & Design
• Luna (Moon) - Code Review & Refactoring
• Mercury - API Integration & Data Flow
• Venus - UI/UX & Visual Design
• Mars - Testing & Debugging
• Jupiter - Feature Development
• Saturn - Documentation & Standards

SPECIALIZED AGENTS (31 more):
Engineering: Uranus (AI/ML), Neptune (Backend), Ceres (DevOps), Pallas (Mobile)
Marketing: Fortuna (ASO), Eris (Growth), Psyche (TikTok), Juno (Social)
Design: Hera (Brand), Metis (UX Research), Titan (Visual), Eros (Whimsy)

PM: Atlas (Shipping), Rhea (Production), Io (Experiments)
Operations: Hygeia (Analytics), Plutus (Finance), Vulcan (Infrastructure)
Testing: Ganymede (API), Europa (Performance), Callisto (Analysis)

Each agent is a specialized prompt that works with Claude Code to autonomously
execute tasks in their domain.

Example workflow:
"Sol, design the architecture for a feedback widget"
→ Sol outputs system design, database schema, API contracts

"Jupiter, implement Sol's design"
→ Jupiter writes production code following Sol's architecture

"Luna, review Jupiter's code"
→ Luna suggests improvements, catches bugs, enforces standards

"Venus, make it beautiful"
→ Venus designs UI components, color schemes, animations

Result: You guide, agents execute. Like having a 38-person dev team.

## Section 7: Who This Is For

### Headline
```
Perfect For Developers Who Want to Ship Faster
```

### Persona 1: Indie Hackers
```
[Icon: Solo developer at laptop]

"I have a full-time job but want to build profitable side projects"

✅ You're technical but short on time
✅ You've started 10 projects, finished 1
✅ You want to quit your job via MicroSaaS income
✅ You need templates to skip the boring parts

With HermeticSaaS: Build on weekends, launch in 30 days, hit $2K MRR,
                   repeat 5x, quit job at $10K MRR.
```

### Persona 2: Agency Owners
```
[Icon: Team collaboration]

"I run a dev agency and want to deliver projects faster with higher margins"

✅ You're tired of reinventing the wheel for every client
✅ You want consistent quality across projects
✅ You need to increase margins without cutting corners
✅ You want to take on more clients without hiring

With HermeticSaaS: Deliver $15K projects in $3K of time. Take on 3x more
                   clients. Increase margins by 40%. Scale without hiring.
```

### Persona 3: Technical Founders
```
[Icon: Startup rocket]

"I'm a CTO/co-founder who needs to validate ideas quickly"

✅ You have limited runway (6-12 months)
✅ You need to test multiple product ideas
✅ You can't afford to spend 3 months on each experiment
✅ You need to find product-market fit fast

With HermeticSaaS: Test 5 ideas in the time it takes to build 1. Find PMF
                   before you run out of runway. Pivot weekly, not quarterly.
```

### Persona 4: Serial Entrepreneurs
```
[Icon: Portfolio of products]

"I want to build a portfolio of cash-flowing MicroSaaS products"

✅ You've sold a startup and have capital to invest
✅ You want multiple income streams
✅ You understand the power of leverage
✅ You'd rather build 10 small bets than 1 big one

With HermeticSaaS: Launch 6 products this year. Keep the 3 winners at $5K
                   MRR each. Sell 3 for $50K each. Portfolio value: $500K+.
```

### NOT For
```
❌ Complete beginners (you need JavaScript/React knowledge)
❌ People who want no-code solutions (this is real code)
❌ Those unwilling to put in work (framework ≠ autopilot)
❌ Non-technical founders (unless paired with a dev)

Be honest: If you can't build a simple React component, wait until you can,
           then come back. HermeticSaaS makes experts faster, it doesn't
           replace learning fundamentals.

 idea in 30 minutes."

"As a CTO at an early-stage startup, we needed to validate 3 different product
 directions. HermeticSaaS let us build and test all 3 in 6 weeks. Found our
 winner and pivoted. Saved us 4 months and probably $100K in wasted dev time."

 held my hand through the entire process. The playbooks are incredibly detailed.
 I launched my first SaaS in 12 days and got my first paying customer on day 2.
 Mind-blowing."

## Section 11: Founder Story

### Headline
```
Why I Built HermeticSaaS
```

### Founder Story
```
[Photo: Your headshot]

Hey, I'm [Your Name].

I've been a developer for [X] years, and I've made every mistake in the book:

• Spent 6 months building products nobody wanted
• Launched to zero customers because I had no marketing plan
• Rebuilt auth/payments from scratch 10+ times
• Wasted $20K on failed projects
• Burned out trying to "do it all"

After my third failed launch, I got smart. I started documenting what worked.
I built reusable templates. I created systems. I turned chaos into process.

Then I discovered Claude Code and the world of AI agents. I thought:
"What if AI could build these systems FOR me?"

So I built the first version of HermeticSaaS using 12 autonomous AI agents.
They built 210+ files autonomously. I guided, they executed.

Then I used the framework to launch my first MicroSaaS product. 7 days from
idea to Product Hunt. #3 product of the day. $2K MRR in month 1.

I launched a second product. Different niche, same framework. 10 days. $3K MRR.

The framework worked. Not just for me - I shared it with 10 friends. 8 of them
launched products. 7 are profitable.

That's when I knew: This needs to be a product.

HermeticSaaS is the framework I wish I had 5 years ago. It would've saved me
$50K+ and years of frustration.

Now I'm sharing it with you.

Will it work for everyone? No. You still need to execute. You still need to
market. You still need to ship.

But if you're willing to put in the work, this framework will 10x your output.

I guarantee it. Literally. 30-day money-back guarantee.

Let's build your MicroSaaS empire together.

## Section 12: FAQ

### Headline
```
Frequently Asked Questions
```

### FAQ Items

**Q: Is this just another boilerplate?**
```
A: No. Most boilerplates give you starter code and stop there. HermeticSaaS
   covers the entire lifecycle: idea discovery (Reddit scraper), building
   (templates + AI agents), launching (Product Hunt playbook), marketing
   (viral strategies), scaling ($1M ARR guides).

   Think of other boilerplates as "Lego blocks" and HermeticSaaS as
   "Lego blocks + instruction manual + expert builder + marketing team."
```

**Q: Do I need to know how to code?**
```
A: Yes. You need JavaScript/TypeScript (or Python for the scraper tools) and
   basic React knowledge. If you can build a simple todo app, you're ready.

   If you're not technical yet, learn the basics first (FreeCodeCamp, Scrimba),
   then come back. This framework makes developers faster, it doesn't replace
   learning fundamentals.
```

**Q: What tech stack does it use?**
```
A: Modern, battle-tested stack:

   Web: Next.js 14, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, Stripe
   Mobile: React Native, Expo 51, RevenueCat, NativeWind
   AI: OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, LangChain
   Infrastructure: Vercel, Railway, Fly.io, Supabase

   Everything is swappable. Don't like Supabase? Use Firebase. Don't like
   Stripe? Use Lemon Squeezy. The architecture is flexible.
```

**Q: Can I use this for client work?**
```
A: Standard license ($997): Personal projects only
   Agency license ($2,997/year): Unlimited client work + white-label rights
   Enterprise license ($9,997/year): Resale rights included

   If you're using it for client projects, you need the Agency license minimum.
```

**Q: How long does it take to launch?**
```
A: Depends on your product complexity:

   Simple MVP: 7-10 days
   Medium complexity: 14-21 days
   Complex product: 30-45 days

   Compare to building from scratch (3-6 months) or using basic boilerplates
   (1-2 months). You're saving 80%+ of development time.
```

**Q: What if I get stuck?**
```
A: Standard license: Comprehensive docs (136 README files) + community support
   Agency license: Priority support (24hr SLA) + monthly framework calls
   Enterprise license: 1-on-1 consulting (4 hours/month)

   Plus: 30-day money-back guarantee. If I can't help you get unstuck, you
   get a full refund.
```

**Q: Do I get updates?**
```
A: Yes! Lifetime updates at your original price. Forever.

   The framework is actively maintained and improves based on real launches.
   When I add new templates, agents, or playbooks, you get them automatically.
   No additional fees ever.
```

**Q: What's the refund policy?**
```
A: 30-day money-back guarantee. No questions asked.

   Try the framework for a month. If you're not satisfied for any reason,
   email me and I'll refund 100% of your money within 24 hours.

   I want customers who love the product, not trapped customers.
```

**Q: Can I see the code before buying?**
```
A: You can see the public parts on GitHub (framework documentation, principles,
   roadmaps). The production code (templates, modules) is private until purchase.

   But with the 30-day guarantee, you can buy, clone the entire repo, review
   everything, and still get a full refund if it's not what you expected.
   Zero risk.
```

**Q: How is this different from using ChatGPT/Claude?**
```
A: Great question! HermeticSaaS was built by AI agents, but it's more than
   just prompts:

   1. Pre-built templates (start at 80%, not 0%)
   2. 38 specialized agent prompts (vs generic chatbot)
   3. Battle-tested architecture (validated through real launches)
   4. Complete playbooks (discovery → $1M ARR)
   5. Self-improving system (learns from each launch)

   You can use both: HermeticSaaS as foundation + Claude for customization.
```

**Q: Is there a free trial?**
```
A: No traditional "trial," but the 30-day money-back guarantee is better.

   With a trial, you get limited access and limited time. With our approach,
   you get FULL access, download everything, use it for 30 days, and still
   get a refund if you want.

   Way better than a trial IMO.
```

**Q: What if my question isn't answered here?**
```
A: Email me: [your email]

   I personally read and respond to every email. Usually within 24 hours.

   Seriously - I want to help you succeed. Your success is my best marketing.
