## 🔍 Hermetic Principle Application

### Accurate (Primary Principle)
**Application in this phase**:
Discovery must be grounded in real data, not assumptions. Every hypothesis must be validated with evidence. User needs must be confirmed through direct research. Market size must be calculated from real numbers.

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Every claim backed by data source
- [ ] User pain points validated with real users (not assumed)
- [ ] Market size calculated from real search/revenue data
- [ ] Competitive analysis based on actual product usage
- [ ] Pricing validated through user surveys

### Divine (Secondary Principle)
**Application**:
Seek opportunities that genuinely serve people and solve real problems. Avoid ideas that manipulate or extract without value creation.

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Problem causes real pain/frustration
- [ ] Solution will meaningfully improve lives
- [ ] Business model is ethical and fair
- [ ] No dark patterns or manipulation required

---

## 🚧 Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Confirmation Bias
**Problem**: Looking for data that confirms what you want to be true
**Solution**: Actively seek disconfirming evidence. Ask "Why won't this work?"
**Agent to help**: Echo (unbiased feedback synthesis)

### Pitfall 2: Analysis Paralysis
**Problem**: Researching forever, never building
**Solution**: Set 3-day limit for discovery. Use viability threshold (>70) to decide.
**Agent to help**: Chronos (prioritization and time management)

### Pitfall 3: Falling in Love with Ideas
**Problem**: Pursuing ideas you love but users don't need
**Solution**: Kill ideas ruthlessly based on data. Users decide, not you.
**Agent to help**: Metis (objective user research)

### Pitfall 4: Ignoring Competition
**Problem**: "No competition means no market" or "Too much competition means impossible"
**Solution**: Some competition validates demand. Find your niche angle.
**Agent to help**: Prometheus (competitive evaluation)

### Pitfall 5: Vanity Metrics
**Problem**: Focusing on likes/upvotes instead of willingness-to-pay
**Solution**: Track paying intent: surveys, pre-orders, email signups with credit card
**Agent to help**: Echo (identifying real signals vs noise)

## 💡 Discovery Wisdom

**"The quality of your MicroSaaS is determined in the discovery phase. Build the right thing before building the thing right."**

Remember:
- Users don't know what they want, but they know what they hate
- Pain points are more valuable than feature requests
- "I would pay for this" < Email signup < Credit card on file
- No competition often means no market
- Perfect is the enemy of validated

**Trust the data. Trust the users. Trust the Hermetic principles.**
