## Platform Differences

### Apple App Store vs Google Play Store

| Aspect | Apple App Store | Google Play Store |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Title Length** | 30 characters | 50 characters |
| **Subtitle** | 30 characters (keyword-rich) | N/A |
| **Short Description** | N/A | 80 characters (crucial!) |
| **Long Description** | 4000 characters (no keyword impact) | 4000 characters (keywords matter) |
| **Keywords Field** | 100 characters (comma-separated) | No dedicated field |
| **Keyword Strategy** | Keywords field + subtitle | Title + description |
| **Update Frequency** | Every 2-4 weeks recommended | Can update daily if needed |
| **Review Process** | 24-48 hours | Instant for metadata only |
| **A/B Testing** | Limited (developer tools) | Built-in (Store Listing Experiments) |
| **Screenshots** | Up to 10 | Up to 8 |
| **Preview Video** | Up to 3 videos (auto-play) | 1 video (YouTube) |
| **In-App Events** | Yes (promoted on store) | N/A |
| **Custom Product Pages** | Yes (iOS 15+) | N/A |

### Key Strategic Differences

**Apple App Store:**
- Keywords field is hidden but critical for search
- Subtitle is your 30-character opportunity for visibility
- Description is for conversion, not SEO
- Visual polish matters more (premium perception)
- Updates trigger re-review (plan carefully)
- Feature potential higher (editorials)

**Google Play Store:**
- Description is your main SEO vehicle
- Keyword density matters (but don't stuff)
- Can iterate faster without review delays
- Built-in A/B testing is powerful
- More forgiving of frequent updates
- Long-tail keywords easier to rank for

## Keyword Research Methodology

### The 5-Step Research Process

#### Step 1: Seed Keywords (Core Terms)
```
Template Questions:
- What problem does your app solve?
- What category does it belong to?
- What would users type to find it?
- What do you call it internally?
- What alternatives exist?

Example (Expense Tracker App):
- expense tracker
- budget app
- spending tracker
- money manager
- receipt scanner
```

#### Step 2: Competitor Analysis
```
Process:
1. Identify 5-10 direct competitors
2. Extract their keywords (use tools below)
3. Note their title/subtitle structure
4. Check their ranking positions
5. Find gaps they're missing

Questions to Ask:
- Which keywords do they rank for that I don't?
- Are they missing any obvious terms?
- What's their keyword density in descriptions?
- How often do they update?
- What's their conversion approach?
```

#### Step 3: Search Suggestion Mining
```
Manual Process:
1. Open App Store/Play Store
2. Type seed keywords slowly
3. Note all autocomplete suggestions
4. Type each suggestion + space
5. Record the next suggestions

This reveals:
- Real user search patterns
- Long-tail opportunities
- Current trending terms
- Related problem areas
```

#### Step 4: Volume & Difficulty Assessment
```
For Each Keyword, Evaluate:

Volume (Search Popularity):
- High: 10,000+ searches/month
- Medium: 1,000-10,000
- Low: 100-1,000
- Micro: <100

Difficulty (Competition):
- High: 50+ apps with 1000+ reviews
- Medium: 20-50 apps with reviews
- Low: <20 competing apps
- Opportunity: High volume + low difficulty

Priority Formula:
Score = (Volume / 10) - (Difficulty * 2)
Higher score = higher priority
```

#### Step 5: Intent Classification
```
Classify Keywords by User Intent:

Problem-Aware:
- "track my spending"
- "save money app"
- "budget help"

Solution-Aware:
- "expense tracker"
- "budget app"
- "receipt scanner"

Product-Aware:
- "mint alternative"
- "ynab competitor"
- "[competitor name] vs"

Transactional:
- "best budget app"
- "free expense tracker"
- "budget app download"
```

### Keyword Research Tools Matrix

| Tool | Platform | Price | Best For | Limitations |
|------|----------|-------|----------|-------------|
| **App Radar** | Both | $79/mo | All-in-one ASO | Expensive for solos |
| **Sensor Tower** | Both | $99/mo | Market intelligence | Steep learning curve |
| **AppTweak** | Both | $83/mo | Competitive analysis | Complex interface |
| **Mobile Action** | Both | $79/mo | Keyword tracking | Data lag |
| **AppFollow** | Both | $29/mo | Review management | Limited keyword data |
| **TheTool** | iOS only | Free tier | Quick keyword checks | iOS only |
| **Google Keyword Planner** | Web/Play | Free | Volume estimates | Not app-specific |
| **AnswerThePublic** | Both | Free tier | Question keywords | Not app-focused |
| **App Annie (data.ai)** | Both | $Custom | Enterprise insights | Very expensive |

**Budget Recommendation for Solo Founders:**
- Start: Manual research + free tools ($0)
- Growing: AppFollow ($29/mo) for reviews + manual keyword work
- Scaling: App Radar or AppTweak ($79-83/mo) when revenue > $2k/mo

## Title & Subtitle Optimization

### Apple App Store Title Strategy (30 Characters)

**Formula Templates:**

```
Option 1: Brand + Primary Keyword
[Brand]: [Keyword] & [Feature]
Example: "Spendly: Budget & Expenses"
Character count: 27

Option 2: Keyword-First
[Keyword] - [Brand] [Descriptor]
Example: "Budget Tracker - Spendly Pro"
Character count: 30

Option 3: Value Proposition
[Brand] - [Benefit] [Category]
Example: "Spendly - Save Money Daily"
Character count: 28

Option 4: Hybrid
[Brand] | [Primary] + [Secondary]
Example: "Spendly | Budget + Receipt"
Character count: 27
```

**Character Count Optimization:**
```
Every character counts:
- Use "&" instead of "and" (+2 chars)
- Use "+" instead of "and" (+2 chars)
- Abbreviate where clear: "Pro" not "Professional" (+9 chars)
- Remove articles: "The", "A" (+3-4 chars)
- Use symbols: "—" "-" "|" for separation
```

### Subtitle Optimization (30 Characters)

**Purpose Hierarchy:**
1. **Primary:** Add 2-3 searchable keywords
2. **Secondary:** Clarify value proposition
3. **Tertiary:** Brand differentiation

**Effective Patterns:**

```
Feature-Focused:
"Track, Budget & Save Money"
"Scan Receipts, Track Spending"
"Daily Budget & Bill Reminder"

Benefit-Focused:
"Save More, Stress Less"
"Your Money, Simplified"
"Budgeting Made Easy"

Hybrid (Best):
"Easy Budget & Expense Track"
"Save Money with Smart Budget"
"Track Spending & Save Daily"
```

**Keyword Loading Strategy:**
```
Maximum keyword inclusion:
"Budget, Expense & Bill Tracker"

This subtitle includes:
- budget (high volume)
- expense (high volume)
- bill (medium volume)
- tracker (qualifier)

Total: 4 searchable terms in 30 chars
```

### Google Play Title Strategy (50 Characters)

**Advantages of 20 Extra Characters:**
- Include 3-4 keywords instead of 2-3
- More descriptive value propositions
- Room for clarifying details

**Formula Templates:**

```
Extended Keyword Loading:
"[Brand] - [Keyword] [Keyword] [Keyword] & [Feature]"
Example: "Spendly - Budget Expense Tracker & Bill Manager"
Characters: 50

Value + Keywords:
"[Brand]: [Benefit] with [Keyword] & [Keyword]"
Example: "Spendly: Save Money with Budget & Expense Tracker"
Characters: 50

Category + Features:
"[Brand] - [Category]: [Feature], [Feature] & [Feature]"
Example: "Spendly - Budget App: Track, Scan & Save Money"
Characters: 48
```

### Title Optimization Checklist

4. Background: Branded color or gradient

   - Question format vs statement
   - Statistics vs emotional appeals

## Review Generation

### Ethical Review Building Strategy

**The Hermetic Approach:**
- Never buy fake reviews (instant ban risk)
- Never incentivize reviews (against policy)
- Never review-gate features
- Always make review prompts optional
- Focus on earning reviews through value
- Respond to all reviews (positive and negative)

### When to Request Reviews

**Timing is Everything:**

```
High-Value Moments (Best Times):
✓ After user completes a goal
✓ After solving a major pain point
✓ After positive customer support interaction
✓ After user returns 5+ times
✓ After user explores premium features
✓ On achievement milestones

Poor Moments (Never Request):
✗ On first app open
✗ After an error or crash
✗ During user frustration
✗ When feature isn't working
✗ Before user sees value
✗ More than 3 times per year per user
```

**Implementation Example:**

```swift
// iOS - Native Review Prompt (Best Practice)
import StoreKit

func requestReviewIfAppropriate() {
    let userDefaults = UserDefaults.standard
    let lastReviewRequest = userDefaults.object(forKey: "lastReviewRequest") as? Date
    let appOpenCount = userDefaults.integer(forKey: "appOpenCount")
    let goalCompletionCount = userDefaults.integer(forKey: "goalsCompleted")

    // Only request review if:
    // - User opened app 10+ times
    // - User completed 3+ goals
    // - At least 60 days since last request
    // - Not requested more than 3 times ever

    let daysSinceLastRequest = Calendar.current.dateComponents([.day],
        from: lastReviewRequest ?? Date.distantPast, to: Date()).day ?? 999

    if appOpenCount >= 10 &&
       goalCompletionCount >= 3 &&
       daysSinceLastRequest >= 60 {

        if let scene = UIApplication.shared.connectedScenes.first as? UIWindowScene {
            SKStoreReviewController.requestReview(in: scene)
            userDefaults.set(Date(), forKey: "lastReviewRequest")
        }
    }
}
```

### In-App Review Prompt Strategies

**Soft Prompt (Pre-Review):**

```
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│  Enjoying Spendly?             │
│                                 │
│  [Yes!] [Not Really]           │
└────────────────────────────────┘

IF "Yes!" → Show native review prompt
IF "Not Really" → Collect feedback form
```

**Context-Specific Prompts:**

```
After Goal Completion:
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│  Congratulations!              │
│  You reached your savings goal!│
│                                 │
│  Mind sharing your success?    │
│  [Leave Review] [Maybe Later]  │
└────────────────────────────────┘

After Problem Solved:
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│  Your issue has been resolved! │
│                                 │
│  How was your support          │
│  experience?                   │
