"and"               &                  2 chars
"plus"              +                  3 chars
"Professional"      Pro                9 chars
"Manager"           Mgr                4 chars
"Application"       App                8 chars
"The [Name]"        [Name]             4 chars
```

**Separators (0 additional chars):**
```
- Hyphen: "Budget - Spendly"
: Colon: "Spendly: Budget"

### Title SEO Best Practices (Google Play)

**Keyword Density Guidelines:**
```
Primary Keyword:    2 times (title + description)
Secondary Keywords: 1-2 times
Avoid:             3+ repetitions (seen as spam)

Good: "Budget App - Budget Tracker & Expense Manager"
     (budget appears 2x naturally)

Bad: "Budget Budget App Budget Tracker Budget Tool"
     (over-optimization penalty)
```

**Keyword Variations Strategy:**
```
Instead of repeating: "budget" 3 times
Use variations: "budget" + "expense" + "spending" + "money"

This covers:
- Users searching "budget app"
- Users searching "expense tracker"
- Users searching "spending monitor"
- Users searching "money manager"
```
