## iOS Description Strategy

### Key Principles for iOS

```

✓ First 3 lines visible without "more" click
✓ Focus on benefits, not keywords
✓ Tell a story, build desire
✓ Include social proof
✓ Clear structure for scanning
```

### The 170-Character Hook

**First 3 lines are CRITICAL (visible without expanding):**

```
Formula: Problem + Solution + Social Proof

Example 1 (Budget App):
"Transform how you manage money. Spendly helps you save $500+ monthly
by tracking every expense automatically. Join 100,000+ users who've
taken control of their finances."

"Get everything out of your head and into organized projects. TaskFlow
helps busy professionals reclaim 10+ hours weekly. Featured in
TechCrunch and loved by 50,000+ users."
(172 characters - trim 2)

Example 3 (Fitness App):
"Build the body you want from home or gym. FitLog provides personalized
workout plans, exercise tracking, and nutrition guidance. Join 200,000+
people transforming their fitness."
