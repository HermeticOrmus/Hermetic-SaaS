### Subtitle Optimization Strategy

**Title + Subtitle Synergy:**

```
Strategy 1: Complementary Keywords
Title:    "Spendly: Budget & Expenses"
Subtitle: "Track Spending, Save Money"
Keywords: budget, expenses, track, spending, save, money (6 unique)

Strategy 2: Feature Extension
Title:    "TaskFlow: To-Do & Projects"
Subtitle: "Notes, Timer & Reminders"
Keywords: to-do, projects, notes, timer, reminders (5 unique)

Strategy 3: Keyword + Benefit
Title:    "FitLog: Workout Logger"
Subtitle: "Build Muscle, Track Progress"
Keywords: workout, logger, build, muscle, track, progress (6 unique)
```

**Avoid Redundancy:**
```
❌ Bad Example:
Title:    "Spendly: Budget Tracker"
Subtitle: "Track Your Budget Daily"
Issue:    "budget" and "tracker/track" repeated

✅ Good Example:
Title:    "Spendly: Budget Tracker"
Subtitle: "Expense & Bill Manager"
Benefit:  Added expense, bill, manager keywords
```

---

### Character Optimization Techniques

**Abbreviations That Work:**
```
Full Word →          Abbreviation    Saved Chars
"and" →              &               2
"your" →             (remove)        5
"application" →      app             8
"professional" →     pro             9
"manager" →          mgr             4
"tracker" →          track           2
"planner" →          plan            3
```

**Word Reduction:**
```
Original: "Track Your Daily Spending Habits" (33 chars - TOO LONG)
Reduced:  "Track Daily Spending Habits" (27 chars - FITS)
Further:  "Track Spending & Save More" (26 chars - BETTER)
```

---

**Test Framework:**

```
