## What's New Strategy

### Why "What's New" Matters

```
IMPACT ON ASO:
‚úì Shows active development (ranking signal)
‚úì Resets review count (iOS) - fresh start opportunity
‚úì Re-engages lapsed users (notifications)
‚úì Opportunity to refresh metadata keywords
‚úì Increases conversion (shows momentum)

VISIBILITY:
- Appears on app page for current users
- Shows in "Updates" tab
- Can trigger update notifications
- Indexed for some keyword searches (minor)
```

### Character Limits

```
iOS App Store:
- Limit: 4,000 characters
- Realistically: 170 characters visible without "more"
- Sweet spot: 300-500 characters total

Google Play Store:
- Limit: 500 characters
- All visible without expansion
- Sweet spot: 200-400 characters

STRATEGY:
Write for the visible limit (170/500 chars) but include
complete details for users who expand.
```

---

## Update Frequency

### Optimal Update Cadence

```
STARTUP PHASE (First 3 months):
- Frequency: Every 2-3 weeks
- Why: Show momentum, fix bugs quickly, gather reviews
- Focus: Bug fixes, small improvements, polish

GROWTH PHASE (3-12 months):
- Frequency: Every 4-6 weeks
- Why: Regular improvements without disruption
- Focus: New features, optimizations, user requests

MATURE PHASE (12+ months):
- Frequency: Every 6-8 weeks
- Why: Sustainable pace, meaningful updates
- Focus: Major features, refinements, seasonal

AVOID:
‚úó Daily/weekly updates (looks unstable)
‚úó 6+ months without update (looks abandoned)
‚úó Update just for the sake of updating
```

### Update Timing Strategy

```
BEST TIMES TO UPDATE:

SEASONAL:
- Early January (New Year momentum)
- Early September (Back to school)
- Late November (Holiday prep)
- April (Spring refresh)

STRATEGIC:
- After major iOS/Android release
- Before holiday weekends (more usage time)
- Start of month (budget refresh)
- When competitors are quiet

AVOID:
- Right before holidays (users traveling)
- During major news events (attention elsewhere)
- Same week as iOS/Android updates (review delays)
```

## What's New Best Practices

### Writing Tips

```
DO:

‚úì Include emoji sparingly (1-2 max)
‚úì Thank users for feedback

‚úì Update for each release

DON'T:

[budget, expenses, plan keywords naturally included]

Android:
"What's New" has stronger search weight. Include:
- Primary keywords 1-2 times

Track your spending with AI-powered budget insights..."
[budget, expense, tracking, spending keywords]
```

"Ready to save more money?"
"Want to reach your goals faster?"
