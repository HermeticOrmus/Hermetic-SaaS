Thanks for trying TaskFlow, David. I hear you on needing recurring tasks - it's actually on our roadmap for Q1 2025. In the meantime, you can duplicate tasks, but I know that's not ideal. If you'd like to discuss your specific use case, email alex@taskflow.app. User feedback like yours shapes what we build next. - Alex, TaskFlow
```

```

## Specific Issue Responses

### Pricing Complaints

**Template 11: "Too Expensive"**
```
I understand [App Name] Premium feels expensive, [Name]. Building [brief value explanation] isn't cheap, but I hear your concern. We offer [free tier details] and [alternative pricing]. If neither works for your situation, email me at [email] and let's see if we can find a solution. - [Your Name], Founder
```

**Examples:**

```
REVIEW: "$10/month is ridiculous for a task app. 1 star."

RESPONSE:
I understand TaskFlow Premium feels expensive, David. Building and maintaining server infrastructure, sync, and continuous updates for thousands of users has real costs, but I hear your concern. We offer a completely free tier (unlimited tasks, 5 projects) and a $30/year option. If neither works for you, email me at alex@taskflow.app and let's talk. - Alex, Founder
```

```
REVIEW: "Was great until they added a paywall. Greedy developers."

RESPONSE:
Sarah, I understand the frustration. Spendly's core features (expense tracking, budgets, reports) are still completely free. Premium adds advanced features (bank sync, receipt scanning) that have ongoing server costs. We need to sustain development somehow. If premium pricing doesn't work for you, the free version is fully functional and always will be. - Alex, Spendly
```

### Comparison to Competitors

**Template 12: "Competitor is Better"**
```
Thanks for trying [App Name], [Name]. I'm glad [Competitor] works well for you - they're a solid choice. We focus on [your differentiation], which resonates with some users but not everyone. If there's a specific feature we're missing that would change your mind, I'd love to hear about it: [email]. - [Your Name], [App Name]
```

**Examples:**

```
REVIEW: "Mint is free and does way more. Why would I pay for this?"

RESPONSE:
Thanks for trying Spendly, Mike. I'm glad Mint works for you - it's a great app. We focus on privacy (we don't sell your data), simplicity (fewer features but easier to use), and direct support (email me anytime). That resonates with some users but not everyone. If there's a specific Mint feature we're missing that you need, I'd love to hear about it: alex@spendly.app. - Alex, Spendly
```

### Feature Requests in Reviews

**Template 13: Feature Request**
```
Great suggestion, [Name]! [Feature they want] is actually something we've been considering. I'd love to learn more about how you'd use it - can you email me at [email]? Your input would directly influence how we design it. Thanks for the feedback! - [Your Name], [App Name]
```

**Examples:**

```
REVIEW: "Needs a widget for the home screen. 3 stars until then."

RESPONSE:
Great suggestion, Lisa! Home screen widgets are actually in development right now for our iOS 17 update coming in February. I'd love to learn more about what you'd want to see in the widget - can you email me at alex@spendly.app? Your input would directly influence the design. Thanks for the feedback! - Alex, Spendly
```

### Accidental Low Rating

**Template 14: Seems Like Mistake**
```
Hi [Name], thanks for the review! I notice you gave us [rating] but your comment seems positive. If you meant to give a different rating, you can edit your review anytime. Either way, we're glad you're enjoying [App Name]! Questions anytime: [email]. - [Your Name], [App Name]
```

**Examples:**

```
REVIEW: ⭐ "This app is amazing! Best task manager ever!"

RESPONSE:
Hi Sarah, thanks for the awesome review! I notice you gave us 1 star but your comment is so positive - I'm wondering if that was accidental? If you meant to give a different rating, you can edit your review anytime in the App Store. Either way, we're so glad you're loving TaskFlow! Questions anytime: alex@taskflow.app. - Alex, TaskFlow
```

### Platform-Specific Issues

**Template 15: Device/OS Issue**
```
[Name], I'm sorry you're having issues on [device/OS]. This might be a [specific platform] bug. We just submitted an update to fix [related issue] - should be live in 24-48 hours. Can you email me at [email] if it's still not working after updating? I want to make sure this works perfectly for you. - [Your Name], [App Name]
```

**Examples:**

```
REVIEW: "Doesn't work on my iPad. Black screen. 1 star."

RESPONSE:
Emma, I'm sorry you're having issues on iPad. This is a known bug with iPad Pro 12.9" on iOS 17.2. We just submitted version 2.4.1 to fix this exact issue - should be live in 24-48 hours. Can you email me at alex@spendly.app if it's still not working after updating? I want to make sure this works perfectly for you. - Alex, Spendly
