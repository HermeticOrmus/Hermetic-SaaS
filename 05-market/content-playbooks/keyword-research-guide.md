## Keyword Research Fundamentals

### What Makes a Good App Store Keyword?

**The Keyword Trifecta:**
```
1. RELEVANCE: Directly describes your app
2. VOLUME: Enough people searching for it
3. DIFFICULTY: Achievable rank with your resources

Perfect keyword = High relevance + High volume + Low difficulty
(These are rare - prioritize relevance > volume > difficulty)
```

Competitor: YNAB
Title: "YNAB: Budget, Personal Finance"

Step 4: Create competitor keyword matrix:

budget          | ✓    | ✓    | ✓           | ✓   | High
expense tracker | ✓    |      | ✓           |     | Medium

```

### Method 3: Related App Discovery

```
Step 1: Search for your seed keyword in App Store

   - Record pain points mentioned

   Example phrases found:
   - "helps me not overspend"

## Competitor Keyword Analysis

### Step-by-Step Competitor Research

#### Step 1: Identify True Competitors

```
Not all apps in your category are competitors.

True Competitors:
✓ Solve same core problem
✓ Target same audience
✓ Similar feature set
✓ Direct alternatives

Example (Budget App):
True Competitors: Mint, YNAB, PocketGuard
Not Competitors: Banks, Investment apps, Crypto wallets
```

#### Step 2: Extract Competitor Keywords

**Manual Method (Free):**

```
For each competitor:

1. Title Keywords
   Example: "Mint: Budget & Track Bills"
   Keywords: budget, track, bills

2. Subtitle Keywords (iOS)
   Example: "Plan spending & save money"
   Keywords: plan, spending, save, money

3. Short Description Keywords (Android)
   Example: "Budget app & expense tracker..."
   Keywords: budget, expense, tracker

4. Category
   Example: Finance > Budget & Planning
   Keywords: finance, budget, planning

5. Visible In-App Purchase Names
   Example: "Premium Budget Tools"
   Keywords: premium, budget, tools
```

**Tool Method (Paid):**

```
Using App Radar / Mobile Action / AppTweak:

1. Enter competitor app name
2. View "Indexed Keywords" report
3. Export keyword list
4. Sort by estimated search volume
5. Identify top 20 keywords they rank for

Compare 5 competitors:
- Keywords ALL competitors use → Must-have
- Keywords SOME competitors use → Opportunities
- Keywords NO competitors use → Gaps (innovation)
```

#### Step 3: Competitor Gap Analysis

**Gap Analysis Template:**

```
Keyword         | Comp1 | Comp2 | Comp3 | Comp4 | Comp5 | You | Opportunity
----------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-----|------------
budget          | ✓     | ✓     | ✓     | ✓     | ✓     | ✓   | Saturated
expense tracker | ✓     | ✓     | ✓     |       |       | ✓   | Medium
bill reminder   | ✓     |       | ✓     |       |       |     | HIGH (gap!)
receipt scan    |       |       | ✓     |       |       | ✓   | HIGH (diff!)
savings goal    | ✓     | ✓     |       |       |       |     | Medium
envelope budget |       |       |       |       |       | ✓   | UNIQUE!

Action Items:

```

## Search Volume vs Difficulty

### Understanding Search Volume

**Volume Indicators (Platform-Specific):**

```
App Store Connect Search Ads:
- Low: 5-20 searches/day
- Medium: 20-100 searches/day
- High: 100-500 searches/day
- Very High: 500+ searches/day

Google Play Console:
- Impressions shown directly
- < 1k impressions/month = Low
- 1k-10k = Medium
- 10k-50k = High
- 50k+ = Very High

Approximate for MicroSaaS:
- Low volume keyword: 1,000-5,000 searches/month
- Medium: 5,000-20,000 searches/month
- High: 20,000+ searches/month
```

### Understanding Keyword Difficulty

**Difficulty Factors:**

```
1. Number of Competing Apps
   Easy: < 20 apps with keyword in title
   Medium: 20-50 apps
   Hard: 50-100 apps
   Very Hard: 100+ apps

2. Competitor Strength
   - How many reviews do top apps have?
   - What are their ratings?
   - How long have they been ranking?

3. Exact Match vs Partial Match
   - Exact match in title (hardest to outrank)
   - Subtitle/description only (easier)

4. Category Competition
   - Games: Very High difficulty
   - Finance: High difficulty
   - Productivity: Medium-High
   - Niche utilities: Low-Medium
```

**Difficulty Scoring System:**

```
Keyword: [example keyword]

Factor 1: Competing Apps
Count apps with keyword in title: ___
Score: 1-10 (1=few, 10=many)

Factor 2: Top App Review Count
Average reviews of top 3 apps: ___
Score: 1-10 (1=<100 reviews, 10=>10k reviews)

Factor 3: Age of Top Apps
How long top app has ranked: ___
Score: 1-10 (1=<6 months, 10=>3 years)

Factor 4: Your App Strength
Your review count: ___
Your rating: ___
Your age: ___
Score: 1-10 (1=new/weak, 10=strong)

Difficulty Score = (F1 + F2 + F3) / 3
Achievability Score = 10 - |Difficulty - Your Strength|

Priority = (Search Volume / 100) * Achievability Score
```

### The Sweet Spot Formula

```
IDEAL KEYWORD PROFILE:

Volume: Medium (5k-20k searches/month)
Difficulty: Low-Medium (< 50 competing apps)
Relevance: Perfect (exactly describes your app)

Why this works:
✓ Enough traffic to matter
✓ Achievable with modest resources
✓ Drives qualified users

Example:
"envelope budget app"
- Volume: ~3k/month (lower but qualified)
- Difficulty: Low (12 competitors)
- Relevance: Perfect (if you have envelope budgeting)
→ EXCELLENT TARGET
```

---

## Long-Tail Keyword Strategy

### What Are Long-Tail Keywords?

```
Short-Tail (Head):
- "budget app"
- 100,000+ searches/month
- Very high competition
- Low conversion (generic intent)

Medium-Tail:
- "budget app for couples"
- 5,000-20,000 searches/month
- Medium competition
- Medium conversion

Long-Tail:
- "budget app for couples with debt payoff"
- 500-2,000 searches/month
- Low competition
- HIGH conversion (specific intent)
```

### Long-Tail Keyword Generators

**Template Formulas:**

```
[Category] + [Feature]
Examples:
- budget app + receipt scanner
- task manager + pomodoro timer
- workout tracker + gym plans

[Category] + [Audience]
Examples:
- budget app + freelancers
- todo list + students
- meal planner + vegans

[Category] + [Outcome]
Examples:
- budget app + save money
- workout tracker + build muscle
- time tracker + bill clients

[Category] + [Platform/Device]
Examples:
- budget app + apple watch
- notes app + ipad
- timer + widget

[Category] + [Modifier]
Examples:
- budget app + simple
- task manager + offline
- notes + encrypted

[Category] + [Use Case]
Examples:
- budget app + envelope method
- timer + study sessions
- tracker + intermittent fasting
```

### Long-Tail Discovery Process

```
Step 1: Start with seed keyword
Example: "budget app"

Step 2: Add qualifiers systematically

Audience qualifiers:
- budget app for couples
- budget app for students
- budget app for freelancers
- budget app for families

Feature qualifiers:
- budget app with receipt scanner
- budget app with bank sync
- budget app with bill reminders

Benefit qualifiers:
- budget app to save money
- budget app to pay off debt
- budget app to track spending

Step 3: Check each in App Store autocomplete

Step 4: Note which ones autocomplete
(If it autocompletes, people are searching it!)

Step 5: Prioritize by:
- Autocomplete suggestion = High priority
- No autocomplete but relevant = Medium priority
- No data = Low priority (but might be untapped)
```

### Long-Tail Implementation

**Where to Use Long-Tail Keywords:**

```
iOS:
✓ Keywords field (100 chars - perfect for long-tail)
✓ In-app purchase names
✓ App description (for context)
✗ NOT in title/subtitle (waste of precious space)

Android:
✓ Long description (naturally written)
✓ Feature graphics captions
✓ What's new updates

Example iOS Keywords Field:
"couple budget,freelancer expense,debt payoff,receipt scan,envelope method,student budget,family finance"
```

### When to Update Keywords

**Update Frequency Guidelines:**

```
iOS:
Recommended: Every 4-6 weeks
Minimum: Every 3 months
Maximum: Monthly (if needed)

Considerations:
- Each update triggers app review (24-48 hours)
- Frequent changes can hurt rankings temporarily
- Only update when you have meaningful changes

Android:
Recommended: Every 2-4 weeks
Minimum: Monthly
Maximum: Weekly (metadata-only changes)

Considerations:
- No review for metadata-only changes
- Can iterate faster
- But don't change for the sake of changing
```

**Triggers for Keyword Updates:**

```
IMMEDIATE UPDATE NEEDED:
✓ Major feature launch (new keywords relevant)
✓ Seasonal opportunity (add seasonal terms)
✓ Competitor overtaking you (competitive response)
✓ Keyword ban/violation (remove problematic term)

SCHEDULE UPDATE:
✓ Better keyword opportunities discovered
✓ Systematic A/B test schedule
✓ Performance plateau (need refresh)
✓ Quarterly optimization cycle

NO UPDATE NEEDED:
✗ Rankings slightly fluctuating (normal)
✗ Just because it's been a while
✗ Minor wording preference
✗ Competitor made small change
```
