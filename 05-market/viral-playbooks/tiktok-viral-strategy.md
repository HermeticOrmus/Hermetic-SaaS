## Algorithm Understanding 2025

### How TikTok Decides What Goes Viral

**The Three-Tier System:**
1. **Initial Pool (200-500 views)** - TikTok tests your content
2. **Secondary Pool (1K-5K views)** - If metrics are strong
3. **Viral Pool (10K+ views)** - Exponential growth phase

**Key Algorithm Signals (Ranked by Impact):**
1. **Completion Rate** (60% weight) - Did they watch to the end?
2. **Rewatch Rate** (20% weight) - Did they loop it?
3. **Share Rate** (10% weight) - Did they send it to friends?
4. **Comment Rate** (5% weight) - Did they engage?
5. **Like Rate** (3% weight) - Vanity metric
6. **Follow Rate** (2% weight) - Long-term signal

**Critical First Hour:**
- First 100 views determine your trajectory
- Post when your audience is most active (use TikTok analytics)
- Respond to every comment in first 60 minutes
- Share to Instagram Stories/Twitter immediately

**2025 Algorithm Updates:**
- Longer videos (60-90s) getting pushed harder
- Original sounds boost reach by 40%
- Face-to-camera content prioritized
- Educational content (3min+) has own algorithm track
- "Watch again" button weighted heavily

## Content Formats for SaaS

### Format 1: The Problem Dramatization (15-30s)

**Structure:**
```
Hook (3s): "POV: You're still doing [painful task] manually"
Problem (5s): Show someone struggling dramatically
Transition (2s): "There's a better way..."
Solution (10s): Quick demo of your app solving it
CTA (5s): "Link in bio"
```

**Script Template:**
```
[Face camera, frustrated expression]
"I just wasted 4 hours doing [task] that should take 5 minutes"

[Cut to screen recording]
"Then I found [YourApp]..."

[Speed through solution]
"Now it takes literally 30 seconds"

[Back to face]
"Why didn't I find this sooner? Link in bio"
```

**Real Example (Invoice Generator SaaS):**
```
Hook: "POV: Your client wants a 'professional invoice' in 10 minutes"
Problem: *frantically Googling invoice templates*
Transition: *discover app*
Solution: *tap, tap, done - professional invoice*
Result: "Sent it in 45 seconds. I'm never going back."
```

### Format 2: The Speed Run (10-15s)

**Structure:**
```
Hook: "Watch me do [task] in under 30 seconds"
Timelapse: Screen recording at 2-3x speed
Result: "Done. That used to take me 2 hours."
```

**Best For:** Task automation, productivity tools, AI assistants

**Example Script:**
```
"Building a landing page in 30 seconds"
[Sped up screen recording]
"Before [YourApp]: 3 hours"
"After: 30 seconds"
"I'm never coding from scratch again"
```

### Format 3: Before/After Transformation (20-40s)

**Structure:**
```
Hook: "This is what [task] looked like before vs after [YourApp]"
Before: Messy, chaotic, time-consuming
After: Clean, simple, fast
Reveal: Show the time/money saved
```

**Example (Email Marketing Tool):**
```
"My email workflow before [App]:"
- 6 different tools
- 3 hours per newsletter
- $200/month in subscriptions

"After:"
- 1 tool
- 20 minutes per newsletter
- $29/month

"The dashboard alone is worth it"
```

### Format 4: Tutorial Hooks (45-90s)

**Structure:**
```
Hook: "How to [achieve desirable outcome] in 2 minutes"
Step 1: Quick setup
Step 2: Main action
Step 3: Result
CTA: "Full tutorial in bio"
```

**Pro Tip:** Leave them wanting more - don't show everything

**Example (SEO Tool):**
```
"How I rank #1 on Google in 24 hours"
1. "Paste your URL here"
2. "Get your keywords"
3. "Copy this exact content structure"
Result: "Ranked #3 the next day"
CTA: "Full method in bio"
```

### Format 5: Behind-the-Scenes Builder (30-60s)

**Structure:**
```
Hook: "Building a feature people actually asked for"
Context: What problem it solves
Process: Quick build montage
Launch: User reactions
```

**Why It Works:** People love watching creation

**Example:**
```
"3 people asked for dark mode today"
[Montage of coding]
"4 hours later..."
[Ship it]
"The replies are insane" [show notifications]
```

### Format 6: User Testimonial Remix (20-30s)

**Structure:**
```
Hook: Read the best user quote
Show: Their actual results/screenshot
Proof: Your reaction or more data
CTA: "You could be next"
```

**Example (Analytics Tool):**
```
[Hold up phone with review]
"Just read this review..."
[Show: "Found $10K in wasted ad spend in 5 minutes"]
"This is why I built this"
[Show dashboard]
"Link in bio if you're bleeding money too"
```

### Format 7: Myth-Busting (25-45s)

**Structure:**
```
Hook: "Everyone says you need [expensive thing]"
Bust: "That's BS. Here's what you actually need"
Solution: Show your tool as the real answer
Proof: Results or testimonial
```

**Example (CRM Tool):**
```
"Everyone: 'You need Salesforce'"
"Me: 'You need to track 10 customers, not 10,000'"
[Show simple CRM]
"This costs $15/mo and does everything you need"
"Stop overpaying for features you'll never use"
```

## Final Thoughts

TikTok success for SaaS is not about going viral once. It's about:

1. **Consistency**: Post daily for 90 days minimum
2. **Authenticity**: Show the real founder, real product, real results
3. **Value**: Every video should teach or solve something
4. **Speed**: Jump on trends within 48 hours
5. **Community**: Respond to every comment in first hour

Your advantage as a solo founder: You ARE the face of the brand. People buy from people, not faceless companies. Show up, be real, provide value, and the algorithm will reward you.

Start with Day 1 tomorrow. Don't overthink it. Your first 10 videos will be rough. That's okay. Video 30 will be 10x better because you learned by doing.

The best time to start was yesterday. The second best time is right now.
