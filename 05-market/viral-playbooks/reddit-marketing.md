- Friendly to makers
- Example: r/SaaS, r/SideProject, r/IMadeThis

**Tier B: Problem Communities (5-10 subreddits)**
- Where your target users hang out
- Discuss the problems you solve
- Example: r/productivity, r/smallbusiness

**Tier C: Adjacent Communities (5 subreddits)**
- Related but not direct fit
- Opportunity to help and learn
- Example: r/EntrepreneurRideAlong

**Tracking Spreadsheet:**
```
| Subreddit | Members | Vibe | Launch-OK? | Karma Req? | Notes |
|-----------|---------|------|------------|------------|-------|
| r/SaaS    | 150K    | Supportive | YES | 50 | Post Sat |
```

## Community Engagement Tactics

### The 90-Day Pre-Launch Engagement Plan

**Goal:** Build credibility before you ever mention your product

**Month 1: Observation & Contribution**

**Week 1-2: Pure Value, Zero Promotion**
- Comment helpfully on 5 posts per day
- Answer questions in your expertise area
- Upvote quality content
- Learn community language and norms

**Example Comments:**
```
"I struggled with this too. Here's what worked for me:
[3-4 genuinely helpful bullets]
Hope this helps!"
```

**Week 3-4: Establish Expertise**
- Create 2-3 valuable posts (tutorials, guides)
- Share learnings, not products
- Engage deeply in comment threads
- Build reputation as helpful member

**Example Post:**
```
Title: "How I automated [task] and saved 10 hours/week"

Body: [Detailed tutorial using free tools, NOT your product]
"Happy to answer questions!"
```

**Month 2: Credibility Building**

**Week 5-6: Problem Validation**
- Ask questions about pain points

```

**Week 7-8: Soft Introduction**

**Month 3: Pre-Launch Momentum**

**Template:**

It's at the beta stage and I'd love feedback from people who actually face this problem.

- [Benefit 3]

What I need help with:

```

**Week 11-12: Build Hype**

- Create anticipation for launch

### Daily Engagement Routine

## Launch Announcement Strategy

### The Perfect Launch Post Formula

**Anatomy of a High-Converting Launch Post:**

**Title (Critical - 60% of Success):**

**What Works:**
```
"I built [tool] to solve [specific pain point] - would love feedback"
"Spent 6 months building [tool] for [audience] - here's what I learned"
"Show HN: [Tool] - [Specific benefit in 5 words]"
"[Tool] - I was frustrated with [problem] so I built this"
```

**What Fails:**
```
"Check out my new SaaS!" (Too vague)
"Launching [BrandName] today!" (Too promotional)
"Best [tool] ever made!" (Too boastful)
"[Generic marketing copy]" (Too salesy)
```

**Formula:**
```
[Tool Name] - [Specific problem it solves] for [target user]
```

**Body Structure:**

**Section 1: The Hook (First 2 sentences)**
```
Start with WHY you built it.
Make it relatable.

Example:
"I wasted 3 hours every week doing [task] manually. After complaining about it on this subreddit 6 months ago, I decided to build a solution."
```

**Section 2: The Problem (2-3 sentences)**
```
Elaborate on the pain point.
Show you understand their struggle.

Example:
"Every [target user] I talked to had the same issue: [specific problem]. The existing tools were either too expensive ($100/mo) or too complex (2-week learning curve)."
```

**Section 3: The Solution (Bullet Points)**
```
What your tool does (benefits, not features).

Example:
Here's what it does:
- [Benefit 1]: Saves X hours per week
- [Benefit 2]: Costs $X instead of $Y
- [Benefit 3]: Works in 5 minutes, not 2 weeks
```

**Section 4: The Ask (Clear CTA)**
```
Be humble and specific.

Example:
"I'd love feedback from this community:
- Is this solving the right problem?
- What would make you use it?
- What's missing?

Link: [URL]
It's free while in beta. Sign up and let me know what you think."
```

**Section 5: Gratitude**
```
Thank the community.

Example:
"This community helped inspire this - thank you for the insights over the past months. Happy to answer any questions!"
```

### Launch Post Template (Copy-Paste)

```markdown
Title: [YourTool] - [Problem it solves] for [target users]

Body:

[Personal story - why you built this - 2 sentences]

[The problem elaborated - 2-3 sentences]

Here's what [YourTool] does:
- [Benefit 1]
- [Benefit 2]
- [Benefit 3]

I'd love feedback:
- Is this useful?
- What's confusing?
- What's missing?

Link: [URL]
[Pricing/Access info]

Thank you to this community for the inspiration. Happy to answer questions!

---
Edit: Wow, thanks for the feedback! Answering questions in the comments.
```

### Multi-Subreddit Launch Strategy

**Launch Week Timeline:**

**Day 1 (Saturday morning): r/SaaS**
- Post your main launch announcement
- Spend entire day responding to comments
- Engage deeply with every question
- Note: Saturday has high engagement, low competition

**Day 2 (Sunday): r/SideProject, r/IMadeThis**
- Slightly different angle: "I made this"
- Show your journey
- More casual tone

**Day 3 (Monday): Problem-specific subreddits**
- r/productivity (if productivity tool)
- Customize message to that community
- Reference specific pain points discussed there

**Day 4-5 (Tuesday-Wednesday): r/AlphaandBetausers, r/IndieBiz**
- Offer beta access
- Request feedback
- Build tester community

**Day 6-7 (Thursday-Friday): Adjacent communities**
- Share learnings, not just product
- "What I learned launching my first SaaS"
- Educational angle

**Customization Per Subreddit:**

Don't copy-paste the same post everywhere. Customize:

**r/SaaS Version:**
```
Title: "Launched [Tool] after 6 months - here's what I learned"
Focus: Founder journey, metrics, lessons
```

**r/productivity Version:**
```
Title: "[Tool] - Automates [specific task] in 30 seconds"
Focus: Productivity gains, time saved
```

**r/smallbusiness Version:**
```
Title: "Built [Tool] to save small businesses $X on [expense]"
Focus: Cost savings, ROI
```

### Handling Comments Like a Pro

**Respond to EVERY comment in first 24 hours.**

**Types of Comments & How to Respond:**

**1. Genuine Questions:**
```
Comment: "How does this compare to [Competitor]?"

Response: "Great question! Here's the main difference:

```

Here's why I think this is different:

## Avoiding Spam Detection

### Reddit's Spam Detection System

**How You Get Flagged:**
- Account too new (<30 days)
- Low karma (<100)
- Post same link across multiple subreddits quickly
- Generic copy-paste content
- Only post promotional content
- No comment engagement
- Suspicious voting patterns

**How to Stay Safe:**

**Account Age:**
- Create account 60+ days before launch
- Participate organically
- Build history

**Karma Requirements:**
- Target: 500+ karma before launch
- Mix: 60% comment karma, 40% post karma
- Source: Genuine contributions, not karma farming

**Posting Pattern:**
- Wait 24 hours between posting to different subreddits
- Customize each post (at least 30% different)
- Don't link to same URL more than 3x per week
- Mix promotional with valuable content (10:1 ratio)

**Engagement Pattern:**
- Comment on others' posts more than you post
- Upvote generously
- Award great content occasionally
- Build genuine connections

### The 10:1 Rule

**For every 1 promotional post, make 10 value-adding contributions:**

**Value Contributions:**
1. Helpful comment on someone's question
2. Sharing a resource (not yours)
3. Tutorial post
4. Answering technical question
5. Sharing your failure/learning
6. Asking genuine question
7. Thanking someone for their help
8. Providing feedback on someone's project
9. Sharing industry insight
10. Engaging in discussion

**Then:** 1 mention of your product (subtle)

### Subreddit-Specific Rules

**Before posting ANYWHERE:**

**1. Read the Rules**
- Find in sidebar
- Read ALL of them
- Note posting days/formats
- Check if self-promotion allowed

**2. Check Pinned Posts**
- Many have weekly self-promotion threads
- "Promote your project Friday"
- Use these instead of standalone posts

**3. Study Top Posts**
- How are they formatted?
- What tone works?
- What gets upvoted?

**4. Message Moderators (if unsure)**
```
Template:

"Hi mods,

I've been a member of r/[subreddit] for [time] and have really enjoyed the community.

I built [tool] to solve [problem] that I've seen discussed here often.

I'd love to share it with the community for feedback. I read the rules and believe it fits, but wanted to check first.

Would it be appropriate to post about it? Happy to follow any specific format or guidelines.

Thanks for maintaining such a great community!

[Your username]"
```

### Red Flags That Get You Banned

**Instant Ban Behaviors:**
- Spamming link across 10 subreddits in 1 hour
- Using alt accounts to upvote your posts
- Arguing with moderators
- Deleting and reposting same content
- Ignoring community rules after warning
- Being defensive/aggressive in comments
- Claiming your tool is "better than [established tool]"
- Fake testimonials or reviews

**Shadowban Indicators:**
- Your posts get no votes or comments
- Checking in incognito mode: post doesn't show up
- No one responding to your comments

**How to Check:**
- Go to r/ShadowBan
- Make a post asking for check
- They'll tell you if you're shadowbanned

**How to Fix:**
- Stop all promotional activity
- Contribute genuinely for 2 weeks
- Message Reddit admins explaining situation
- Start fresh with new approach

### Safe Promotion Tactics

**1. The Value-First Post**
```
Instead of: "Check out my new tool!"
Do: "I analyzed 100 [tools] - here's what I found"
[Include your tool in the list, but don't highlight it]
```

**2. The Problem Discussion**
```
Post: "How do you currently handle [problem]?"
Engage with all responses
Later in comments: "I actually built [tool] for this"
Natural, not forced
```

**3. The Learning Share**
```
Post: "What I learned building my first SaaS"
Share genuine insights
Mention your product as context, not focus
Link in comments if asked
```

**4. The AMA Approach**
```
Post: "I'm a solo founder who [achievement] - AMA"
Answer all questions
Mention product when relevant
Build credibility first
```

**5. The Weekly Thread**
```
Many subreddits have:
- "Self-Promotion Saturday"
- "Feedback Friday"
- "Share Your Project Sunday"

Use these instead of standalone posts
```

## Karma Building Strategies

### Why Karma Matters

**Unlocks:**
- Post in karma-restricted subreddits
- Appear more trustworthy
- Avoid spam filters
- Build credibility

**Goals:**
- 500+ total karma before launch
- 100+ post karma
- 400+ comment karma

### Fast Karma Building (Ethical)

**Week 1: Comment Karma (Target: 100)**

**Strategy: Answer Questions**
```
1. Go to r/AskReddit
2. Sort by "Rising"
3. Answer 10 questions you know well
4. Be helpful, genuine, concise
```

**High-Karma Comment Formula:**
```
- Answer the question directly (first sentence)
- Add personal anecdote (2-3 sentences)
- Provide actionable insight
- Keep it readable (paragraphs, not wall of text)
```

**Example:**
```
Question: "What's a skill everyone should learn?"

Your answer: "Basic spreadsheet functions.

I ignored Excel for years thinking it was boring. Then I learned VLOOKUP and it saves me 5 hours every week on reports.

It's not sexy, but compound that time savings over a career and you've gained months of your life back."
```

**Week 2: More Comment Karma (Target: 300 total)**

**Strategy: Sort by Rising**
- Rising posts = early engagement opportunity
- Less competition than "Hot"
- More chance of upvotes

**Subreddits for Karma:**
- r/AskReddit (huge, fast-moving)
- r/LifeProTips (practical advice)
- r/explainlikeimfive (share knowledge)
- Your expertise area (programming, marketing, etc.)

**Week 3-4: Post Karma (Target: 500 total)**

**Strategy: Share Genuinely Valuable Content**

**Tutorial Posts:**
```
r/webdev: "How I built [project] with [stack]"
r/productivity: "My morning routine that doubled my output"
r/Entrepreneur: "Mistakes I made in my first 6 months"
```

**Question Posts:**
```
r/SaaS: "What's your biggest marketing challenge?"
r/startups: "How do you validate ideas before building?"
```

**Resource Posts:**
```
r/programming: "100 free resources for learning [language]"
r/marketing: "Tools I use to run my business for <$100/mo"
```

### Karma Acceleration Tips

**1. Time Your Posts**
- Best times: 7-9am EST, 12-1pm EST
- Weekdays > weekends (except Saturday morning)
- First hour determines trajectory

**2. Craft Better Titles**
```
Bad: "Check this out"
Good: "How I [specific achievement] in [timeframe]"

Bad: "Thoughts?"
Good: "What am I missing in this approach to [problem]?"
```

**3. Format for Readability**
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences)
- Bullet points
- Bold key points
- Break up text walls

**4. Engage With Your Post**
- Respond to every comment in first hour
- Answer questions thoroughly
- Thank people for feedback
- Keep the conversation going

**5. Be Early**
- Comment on Rising posts
- Be the helpful answer when post has <10 comments
- Early comments get more visibility

### What NOT to Do

**Karma Farming Red Flags:**
- Reposting popular memes
- Copy-pasting top comments
- Posting same content across subreddits
- Using bots or vote manipulation
- Buying upvotes (gets you banned)
- Begging for karma

**These hurt your credibility and can get you banned.**

### Karma Maintenance

**Once You Hit 500:**
- Keep contributing value
- Don't coast
- Maintain 10:1 ratio (value:promotion)
- Stay active in your communities

**Lesson:** Patience + community-first = trust

- Hit 5 subreddits in 1 hour
- Generic copy-paste message

**Results:**
- Removed by moderators (4/5 subreddits)
- Shadowbanned on Reddit
- 0 signups
- Negative comments

**Mistakes:**
1. No account history
2. No community participation
3. Obvious spam pattern

### Case Study 4: The Comeback Story

**Background:** After initial failure, founder regrouped

**New Approach:**
- Created fresh account
- Spent 60 days just helping people
- Built 800 karma
- Shared learnings, not products

**Launch (4 months later):**
- Personal story: "I failed at this, here's what I learned"
- Mentioned product as part of journey
- Asked for brutal feedback

**Results:**
- 500+ upvotes
- Community rallied around them
- 1,000+ signups
- Became regular contributor

**Lesson:** Reddit values authenticity and redemption

### Case Study 5: The Micro-Launch Success

**Background:** Niche tool for freelance designers

**Strategy:**
- Ignored big subreddits
- Focused on r/graphic_design (small but targeted)
- Posted tutorial using the tool
- Didn't even mention it was their tool until comments

**Results:**
- 50 upvotes (small subreddit)
- 30 targeted signups
- Conversion rate: 15% (insanely high)
- Paying customers from day 1

**Lesson:** Niche + targeted > broad + generic

### The Reddit Marketing Mindset

**Remember:**
1. Reddit is a community, not an advertising platform
2. Redditors can smell BS from miles away
3. Authenticity > polish
4. Helping > selling
5. Long-term relationships > short-term gains
6. One great post beats 100 spammy ones
7. Your reputation is everything
8. Give 10x what you take

## Final Thoughts

Reddit can be one of your highest-ROI marketing channels if you approach it with respect and authenticity.

**The key principles:**
1. **Community first, promotion second**
2. **Give value for 90 days before asking for attention**
3. **Be genuinely helpful, not transactionally nice**
4. **Respond to every comment like you're talking to a friend**
5. **Build real relationships, not just karma**

**Success on Reddit isn't about gaming the system.**
It's about being a valuable member of a community that happens to have a product that solves their problems.

If you're building something genuinely useful and you engage authentically, Reddit will reward you.

If you're just trying to spam your way to users, you'll get banned and burn credibility.

Choose the long game. It works.
