## Pre-Launch Preparation

### Timeline: 4-6 Weeks Before Launch

**Build Credibility:**
- Upvote 10-20 products daily

- Follow makers in your space
- Join discussions
- Establish yourself as community member

**Why This Matters:**
- New accounts with no history look spammy

- Community trusts active members
- You learn what works by observing

**Week 3-4: Prepare Your Product**

```

### Advanced Tactics

**Tactic 1: Hunter Selection**

**What's a Hunter?**
- Person who submits your product to PH
- Can be you (self-hunt) or someone else
- Hunter gets credit for discovery

**Should You Use a Hunter?**

**Self-Hunt (You submit it):**
- Pros: You control timing, full credit, authentic
- Cons: No network effect from hunter's audience

**Get Hunted:**
- Pros: Hunter's audience sees it, credibility boost
- Cons: Less control, need to coordinate

**How to Find a Hunter:**
- Active PH community members with followers
- Someone in your network who's active on PH
- Reach out 2 weeks before: "Would you be interested in hunting [Product]?"

**Best Practice:** Only get hunted by someone who genuinely likes your product

**Tactic 2: Thumbnail Optimization**

**Your First Image is Everything:**
- 80% of people decide to click based on thumbnail
- Test 3-5 variations
- A/B test with small group
- Choose the one that gets most "wow" reactions

**Winning Thumbnail Elements:**
- Clear product name
- Compelling tagline
- Eye-catching visual
- Not too busy
- Professional but authentic

**Tactic 3: Strategic Timing**

**Best Days to Launch:**
- Tuesday-Thursday (most active)
- Avoid Mondays (weekend hangover)
- Avoid Fridays (people check out early)
- Avoid holidays

**Avoid Big Launches:**
- Check PH upcoming launches
- Don't launch same day as major product (Apple, Google, etc.)
- Sometimes better to be #1 on slower day than #5 on busy day

**Tactic 4: Controversy/Debate**

**Create Discussion:**
- Bold claims (backed by data)
- Challenge status quo
- Different approach
- Controversial pricing model

**Example:**
```
Maker comment:

"Unpopular opinion: Most SaaS products are overpriced.

That's why we're pricing [ProductName] at $9/mo instead of $99/mo.

We believe [your philosophy].

Curious what you think?"
```

**Result:** Comments, debate, engagement = algorithm boost

**Tactic 5: Social Proof Acceleration**

**During Launch:**
- Share every testimonial
- Screenshot positive comments
- Share to Twitter/LinkedIn
- Creates FOMO
- Encourages others to check it out

**Example Tweet:**
```
"The Product Hunt comments are incredible 🙏

[Screenshot of best comment]

[PH Link]"
```

### What NOT to Do

**Banned Tactics:**
- Buying upvotes (instant ban)
- Using bots
- Creating fake accounts
- Vote rings/schemes
- Misleading claims
- Spamming communities

**These will:**
- Get you banned from PH
- Hurt your reputation
- Destroy trust
- Not worth it

**Play Fair:**
- Organic growth only
- Genuine supporters
- Ethical tactics
- Long-term reputation > short-term ranking

## Final Thoughts

Product Hunt isn't just about launch day. It's about:

1. **Community**: Building relationships with makers and users
2. **Feedback**: Getting honest input to improve
3. **Distribution**: Reaching early adopters who care
4. **Credibility**: Earning trust through transparency
5. **Long Game**: Building reputation over time

**Your ranking matters less than:**
- Quality of users you attract
- Feedback you receive
- Relationships you build
- Improvements you make
- Long-term growth trajectory

**The Formula:**
```
Great Product × Authentic Engagement × Strategic Timing × Bit of Luck = Successful Launch
```

Launch when you're ready. Engage authentically. Provide value. Follow up consistently.

The makers who win on Product Hunt aren't the ones with the biggest teams or budgets.

They're the ones who:
- Build products people actually need
- Engage genuinely with community
- Learn from feedback
- Play the long game

You've got this.
