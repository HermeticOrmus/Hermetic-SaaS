pain_point:
  description: "[User's own words]"
  source: "[Platform and link]"
  frequency: "[How often mentioned]"
  severity: "[1-10 scale based on language/engagement]"
  user_segment: "[Who is affected]"
  current_solution: "[How they solve it now]"
  willingness_to_pay_signals: "[Any monetary indicators]"
```

---
