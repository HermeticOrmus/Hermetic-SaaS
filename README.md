# HermeticSaaS
> **The Complete MicroSaaS Framework: From Idea to Launch, Powered by Claude Code & 38 Autonomous Agents**

Here's what's extraordinary: Most frameworks give you code templates and stop there. HermeticSaaS gives you an **entire execution workforce**—38 specialized AI agents that handle discovery, architecture, development, testing, deployment, marketing, monetization, and scaling.

It's not just a boilerplate. It's a **system that thinks with you**.

---

## 🎯 Vision

**State an idea → Hermetic Agents execute everything → Fully launched MicroSaaS**

Think about what that means: You go from "I wonder if this idea could work" to a live, marketed, monetized product in days—not months. Not because we skip steps, but because we've systematized the entire journey and automated the parts that don't need human creativity.

Here's the elegant part: The agents don't just follow scripts. They collaborate. Sol designs architecture → Iris scaffolds following that design → Jupiter builds features using that structure → Luna reviews for quality → Mars tests everything → Atlas orchestrates the launch.

**It's like having a dev team that never sleeps, never forgets context, and improves with every build.**

---

## 🪐 Core Philosophy

### The Six Hermetic Principles

Every process, every agent, every line of code embodies these principles:

- **Functional**: Everything must work perfectly, every time. No bugs, no broken promises.
- **Formless**: Adapt to any idea, any market, any tech stack. Flexibility without fragility.
- **Accurate**: Precision in validation and execution. Data over guesses.
- **Divine**: Serve the higher purpose of value creation. Build things that matter.
- **Elegant**: Beautiful simplicity in complex systems. The best code is invisible.
- **No Schemes**: Pure utility, no dark patterns, no manipulation. Radical transparency.

### The MicroSaaS Flywheel

**Discover** → **Learn** → **Build** → **Ship** → **Market** → **Sell** → **Maintain** → **Evolve** → *Repeat*

Each phase feeds the next. Each iteration makes the framework smarter. This isn't a linear process—it's a self-improving system.

---

📝 **Field Notes from Hermetic Ormus**
*Context: Building the framework's 8-phase system*

Most frameworks fail because they skip validation or marketing. They give you auth and payments, then wish you luck.

We learned this the hard way: **Every phase matters equally.** You can't build great product without understanding the market (Discover). You can't market effectively without elegant design (Build). You can't scale without data (Evolve).

**Try this**: Don't skip phases. Even if you think you know your market, run the discovery tools. Even if you're technical, use the marketing playbooks. The framework is designed to catch blind spots.

**Watch for**: The urge to skip ahead to building. That's when you make expensive mistakes.

**This works because**: Each phase de-risks the next phase. Discovery de-risks building. Building de-risks shipping. Shipping de-risks marketing. It's systematic success.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Single Command Execution

```bash
# Full pipeline: idea to launched MicroSaaS
/microsaas "Build an AI tool that helps introverts practice phone calls"

# Phase-specific execution
/discover "AI productivity tools for developers"
/build-mvp "PhoneAnxiety Practice App"
/ship "my-app"
/market "my-app"
```

Here's the hack: These aren't just shortcuts. They're **agent chains**. Each command triggers 5-10 agents working in sequence, passing context between them. You get the work of a team in a single command.

**What makes this structure elegant**: It mirrors the human product development process, but **systematized**. Each phase has everything you need—playbooks, code, agents—to complete that phase. You're never wondering "what's next" or "how do I do this."

---

## 🌟 The 8-Phase Methodology

### Phase 1: DISCOVER (Idea → Validation)
**Goal**: Find and validate profitable MicroSaaS opportunities

**What's clever here**: Most people guess at ideas. We **mine Reddit for pain points**, score them by emotional intensity + trend velocity, and give you a quantified BUILD/MAYBE/PASS decision.

**Hermetic Agents**:
- **Janus** (Trend Research): Scrapes 12 subreddits for pain keywords
- **Echo** (Feedback Synthesis): Analyzes market signals and demand
- **Metis** (UX Research): Validates user needs through surveys

**Deliverables**:
- Market research reports with scoring (0-100 scale)
- Competitor gap analysis
- User pain point documentation (127 mentions = validated)
- BUILD/MAYBE/PASS recommendation

**Workflow**: `/discover "topic"` → Janus scrapes Reddit → Echo validates demand → Metis confirms user needs → Scored opportunity report

---

### Phase 2: LEARN (Research → Understanding)
**Goal**: Acquire knowledge and choose optimal tech stack

**Here's what's different**: We don't just list tech options. Prometheus evaluates based on YOUR constraints (time, budget, skills), then Saturn compiles the EXACT learning resources you need to ship fast.

**Hermetic Agents**:
- **Saturn** (Documentation): Compiles curated learning resources
- **Prometheus** (Tool Evaluation): Recommends tech based on tradeoffs
- **Mentor** (Studio Coach): Creates personalized learning paths

**Deliverables**:
- Tech stack recommendations with rationale
- Learning roadmaps (fastest path to shipping)
- Best practices guides
- Agent training materials

**Workflow**: `/learn-stack "idea"` → Prometheus evaluates tech → Saturn documents best resources → Mentor creates learning path

---

### Phase 3: BUILD (Design → Code)
**Goal**: Rapidly build functional, beautiful MicroSaaS

**The extraordinary part**: Sol architects your entire system FIRST. Then Iris scaffolds following that architecture. Then Jupiter builds features using that structure. **They collaborate**—each agent builds on the previous agent's work.

**Hermetic Agents**:
- **Sol** (Architecture): Designs system structure (database, APIs, auth flow)
- **Iris** (Rapid Prototyping): Scaffolds project following Sol's design
- **Uranus** (AI/ML): Integrates AI features (OpenAI, Claude, LangChain)
- **Jupiter** (Feature Development): Builds core features
- **Venus** (UI/UX): Creates beautiful, accessible interfaces
- **Eros** (Whimsy): Adds delightful micro-interactions

**Deliverables**:
- Architecture blueprints (system design docs)
- Scaffolded projects (ready to develop)
- Core features implemented (auth, payments, core logic)
- Beautiful, delightful UI

**Workflow**: `/build-microsaas "name"` → Sol architects → Iris scaffolds → Uranus adds AI → Jupiter builds → Venus designs → Eros delights

**What makes this fast**: You're not starting from zero. You're starting from 80% complete with battle-tested templates. You focus on the 20% that's unique to your idea.

---

### Phase 4: SHIP (Test → Deploy)
**Goal**: Launch production-ready MicroSaaS

**The hack**: Most launches fail because of forgotten steps. We have a 200+ item checklist that Atlas runs through. Nothing is missed. Ever.

**Hermetic Agents**:
- **Mars** (Testing): Runs comprehensive tests (unit, integration, E2E)
- **Callisto** (Test Analysis): Analyzes results, finds patterns
- **Atlas** (Project Shipping): Orchestrates entire launch sequence
- **Ceres** (DevOps): Sets up CI/CD, auto-deploy, monitoring

**Deliverables**:
- Tested, production-ready code (90%+ test coverage)
- Deployed infrastructure (Vercel/Railway/Fly.io)
- CI/CD pipelines (auto-deploy on merge to main)
- Launch documentation

**Workflow**: `/ship "app"` → Mars tests everything → Callisto analyzes → Ceres deploys infrastructure → Atlas orchestrates launch

---

### Phase 5: MARKET (Content → Growth)
**Goal**: Drive awareness and viral growth

**Here's what we learned**: Great products don't win. Great **stories** win. Psyche creates a narrative arc for your launch. Eris builds viral loops INTO the product. Fortuna optimizes your store presence for discovery.

**Hermetic Agents**:
- **Psyche** (TikTok/Viral): Creates viral content strategies (2025 algorithm insights)
- **Eris** (Growth Hacking): Implements growth loops and referral mechanics
- **Fortuna** (App Store): Optimizes listings with 50+ title formulas
- **Calliope** (Content): Generates blog posts, social content, launch announcements
- **Juno** (Social Media): Manages Twitter/LinkedIn presence
- **Vesta** (Community): Builds engaged Discord/community

**Deliverables**:
- Viral content strategies (30-day calendar)
- Growth hacking implementations (referral loops, viral hooks)
- Optimized app store listings (ASO keywords, screenshots)
- Marketing campaigns (launch week plan)

**Workflow**: `/market "app"` → Psyche creates viral strategy → Eris hacks growth → Fortuna optimizes ASO → Calliope generates content

---

### Phase 6: SELL (Traffic → Revenue)
**Goal**: Convert users and generate revenue

**The insight**: Pricing isn't about competitors. It's about **perceived value**. Plutus helps you price based on value delivered, not hours worked. Then we optimize every step of the funnel.

**Hermetic Agents**:
- **Plutus** (Finance): Sets up pricing strategy & payment processing
- **Chronos** (Sprint Prioritization): Prioritizes features that convert

**Deliverables**:
- Pricing strategies (value-based, psychological pricing)
- Payment integrations (Stripe, Lemon Squeezy - production code)
- Conversion funnels (optimized landing → trial → paid)
- Revenue tracking (MRR dashboards)

**Workflow**: `/monetize "app"` → Plutus sets pricing based on value → Payments integrated → Conversion funnels built → Revenue tracking live

---

### Phase 7: MAINTAIN (Monitor → Support)
**Goal**: Keep MicroSaaS healthy and users happy

**What's elegant**: Support doesn't scale linearly with users. Chiron builds an AI chatbot that resolves 90%+ of tickets. The 10% that reach you are the ones that actually need human attention.

**Hermetic Agents**:
- **Hygeia** (Analytics): Sets up comprehensive monitoring (Sentry, LogRocket, MRR tracking)
- **Chiron** (Support): Creates AI-powered support systems
- **Vulcan** (Infrastructure): Maintains 99.9% uptime
- **Themis** (Legal/Compliance): Ensures GDPR, privacy compliance

**Deliverables**:
- Analytics dashboards (revenue, churn, usage, errors)
- Support systems (AI chatbot + human escalation)
- Infrastructure optimization (auto-scaling, caching)
- Compliance documentation (privacy policy, terms)

**Workflow**: `/maintain "app"` → Hygeia monitors everything → Chiron handles support → Vulcan optimizes infra → Themis ensures compliance

---

### Phase 8: EVOLVE (Data → Iterate)
**Goal**: Continuously improve based on data

**The self-improving part**: Io runs A/B tests automatically. Luna refactors code based on what's working. The framework **learns from every product you build** and gets better.

**Hermetic Agents**:
- **Io** (Experiment Tracking): Runs A/B tests with statistical significance
- **Luna** (Code Review): Refactors for scale and maintainability
- **Rhea** (Studio Production): Coordinates improvements across products

**Deliverables**:
- A/B test results (what actually converts)
- Refactored codebase (technical debt paid down)
- Feature iterations (based on data, not guesses)
- Performance improvements (faster, more efficient)

**Workflow**: `/evolve "app"` → Io experiments (test 3 pricing tiers) → Luna refactors (clean up technical debt) → Rhea coordinates → Ship improved v2.0

---

💛 **Gold Hat Note**
*Topic: Framework Evolution & Community Contribution*

This isn't just about YOU shipping faster. It's about all of us raising collective understanding of what actually works in 2025.

When you use HermeticSaaS to launch a product:
- **Document what worked**: Which agents were most valuable? Which playbooks got results?
- **Share your data**: Revenue at 30/60/90 days. Conversion rates. What changed from template to final product.
- **Contribute improvements**: Found a better way to do something? PR it. Your insight helps the next 1,000 builders.

**The framework improves with each launch.** Your data points refine the scoring algorithms. Your learnings update the playbooks. Your code contributions enhance the templates.

**The craft grows when knowledge flows.**

Share what you discover. Document your breakthroughs. Help others see patterns. That's the Hermetic way.

📝 **Field Notes from Hermetic Ormus**
*Context: Discovering the power of specialized agents*

I used to think "just use ChatGPT for everything." Wrong.

Here's the breakthrough: **Specialized agents are better than generalists** because constraints create clarity.

Sol (architecture) can't write features. It ONLY thinks about system design. That makes its architecture recommendations exceptional.

Jupiter (features) can't make UI decisions. It ONLY thinks about functionality. That makes its code focused and maintainable.

**Try this**: Don't ask one agent to do everything. Use Sol for architecture, then pass that architecture to Iris for scaffolding, then to Jupiter for features. Chain them.

**Watch for**: The urge to shortcut and ask Jupiter to design AND build. You'll get mediocre results. Specialized agents chained together > one generalist agent.

**This works because**: The same reason you wouldn't ask your surgeon to also pilot the plane. Specialization creates mastery.

## 🌌 The Hermetic Philosophy in Practice

Each phase follows the ancient principle: **"As above, so below. As within, so without."**

But here's what that actually means in practice:

- **As above, so below**: The framework structure mirrors the product development process. Each phase (above) manifests in specific actions (below).
- **As within, so without**: Your internal clarity (understanding what to build) manifests as external success (a profitable product).

**This isn't mysticism. It's fractal architecture.** Each agent mirrors the full system. Each phase contains all the tools needed for that phase. Understanding one part helps you understand the whole.

That's not magic—that's **intentional design**. And it's beautiful.

💛 **Gold Hat Note**
*Topic: Getting Started & Community*

This isn't just about YOU building faster. It's about all of us creating a new standard for how MicroSaaS products are built.

**Here's how to contribute:**

1. **Use the framework**: Build something. Document your process.
2. **Share your results**: Revenue, conversion rates, what worked, what didn't.
3. **Improve the tools**: Found a bug? PR it. Built a better template? Share it.
4. **Help others**: Answer questions in issues. Share your learnings in discussions.
5. **Build the knowledge base**: Your case study helps 1,000 other builders avoid your mistakes.

**The craft grows when knowledge flows.**

When you launch a product:
- Write a retrospective (what worked, what didn't)
- Share your numbers (revenue, traffic, conversion)
- Contribute improvements back to the framework
- Help the next builder ship faster

**Together, we raise collective understanding of what actually works in 2025.**

That's the Hermetic Ormus way.
