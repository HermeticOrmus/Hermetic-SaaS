Hey [First Name],

Thanks for grabbing the MicroSaaS Idea Validation Checklist!

You can download it here: [LINK]

Quick intro: I'm [Your Name], and I build MicroSaaS products using AI agents.

Over the last [X] months, I've:
• Built a complete framework (210+ files) using 12 autonomous AI agents
• Launched 2 profitable MicroSaaS products in 7 days each
• Helped 500+ developers ship faster with battle-tested templates

This email sequence is going to teach you how I do it.

Tomorrow, I'll share the #1 mistake that kills 80% of MicroSaaS products
before they launch (hint: it happens in the idea phase).

Talk soon,
[Your Name]

P.S. - Hit reply if you have questions. I read every email.

### Email 2: The #1 Mistake (Education + Positioning)
**Subject**: The mistake that killed my first 3 SaaS products
**Send**: Day 1 (24 hours after Email 1)

```
Hey [First Name],

Quick question: How do you pick which SaaS idea to build?

Most developers (including past me) do this:

1. Have a "cool idea" at 2am
2. Spend 3 months building it
3. Launch to crickets
4. Abandon the project

I did this 3 times. Wasted $20K and 18 months.

Here's what I learned:

THE #1 MISTAKE: Building before validating

You need to know 3 things BEFORE writing a single line of code:

✅ Does this pain point exist? (not "I think" but "I know")
✅ Are people actively looking for solutions? (search volume, Reddit mentions)
✅ Will they pay for a solution? (validate pricing first)

How I do it now:

1. Run my Reddit scraper across 12 subreddits
2. Find pain points mentioned 50+ times in 30 days
3. Interview 10 people who have this pain
4. Pre-sell to 5 people before building
5. THEN build (and only if I get 5 pre-sales)

Result: 2/2 products profitable. 100% success rate vs 0% before.

Tomorrow I'll share the exact Reddit scraper script I use (free).

[Your Name]

P.S. - This validation process is built into HermeticSaaS. The framework
      includes a Reddit scraper + opportunity scoring system. More on that later.

### Email 3: Free Tool + More Value
**Subject**: [Tool] My Reddit pain point scraper (yours free)
**Send**: Day 2 (48 hours after Email 1)

```
Hey [First Name],

As promised, here's my Reddit scraper script: [LINK TO GITHUB GIST]

It scrapes 12 subreddits for pain point keywords and gives you:
• Total mentions in last 30 days
• Trend direction (↑ or ↓)
• Top comment threads
• Opportunity score (0-100)

How to use it:

1. Clone the gist
2. Add your subreddits (or use my defaults)
3. Run: python reddit_scraper.py
4. Get ranked list of opportunities

I found my last MicroSaaS idea (now at $3K MRR) using this exact script.
Took 30 minutes.

Try it out and let me know what opportunities you find!

Tomorrow: How I built that product in 7 days (and you can too).

[Your Name]

P.S. - This scraper is included in HermeticSaaS along with 38 AI agents
      that help you build once you've found an opportunity. Speaking of which...

### Email 4: Case Study + Soft Pitch
**Subject**: How I launched a MicroSaaS in 7 days (full breakdown)
**Send**: Day 3 (72 hours after Email 1)

```
Hey [First Name],

You asked for it: Here's the complete breakdown of my last launch.

TIMELINE:
• Day 0: Found idea using Reddit scraper (invoice management for freelancers)
• Day 1-2: Built MVP using my Next.js template (auth + payments pre-built)
• Day 3-4: Added custom features (invoice generator, client portal)
• Day 5: Testing with 3 beta users
• Day 6: Built landing page, Product Hunt assets
• Day 7: Launched on Product Hunt

RESULTS:
• #3 Product of the Day
• 487 upvotes
• 23 email signups
• 5 paying customers ($29/month each)
• $145 MRR on day 1

COST:
• $0 in ads
• $50 in tools (domain, hosting)
• 7 days of my time

The secret? I didn't start from scratch.

I used:
✅ Pre-built templates (auth, payments, analytics already done)
✅ AI agents to build features 4x faster
✅ Proven playbooks (Product Hunt strategy that's worked 3x)

This is exactly what HermeticSaaS gives you:
• 3 starter templates (Next.js, React Native, AI-powered)
• 38 AI agents (like having a dev team)
• Complete playbooks (discovery → $1M ARR)

210+ files. 50,000+ lines of code. Built by autonomous agents.

Normally $997. Launch price: $497 (first 100 customers only).

[BUTTON: Get HermeticSaaS - $497]

Not ready yet? No problem. Tomorrow I'll share how to scale from
$2K to $10K MRR (the playbook I'm using right now).

### Email 5: Scaling Strategy + Strong CTA
**Subject**: $2K → $10K MRR: The 5 levers
**Send**: Day 4 (96 hours after Email 1)

```
Hey [First Name],

Final email in this sequence (don't worry, you'll still hear from me weekly).

Today: How to scale from $2K to $10K MRR.

Most founders think scaling = more traffic. Wrong.

Here are the 5 levers that actually work:

1. PRICING (raise prices by 30-50%)
   • Most founders underprice
   • $29/mo → $49/mo = 69% MRR increase (same customer count)
   • Test every 90 days

2. CONVERSION (2% → 4% = 2x revenue)
   • Better landing page copy
   • Add testimonials (social proof)
   • Offer free trial (reduce friction)

3. RETENTION (reduce churn from 5% → 3%)
   • Onboarding emails (activate users faster)
   • Usage monitoring (help before they churn)
   • Win-back campaigns (recover cancelled users)

4. UPSELLS (10-20% of users upgrade)
   • Basic → Pro tier ($49 → $99)
   • Add-on features (+$20/mo each)
   • Annual plans (12 months upfront)

5. ACQUISITION (more at the top of funnel)
   • SEO (long-term, free traffic)
   • Affiliates (pay 30% commission)
   • Partnerships (cross-promote)

I went from $2K → $8K MRR in 4 months using these exact levers.

All 5 are covered in HermeticSaaS:
• Pricing frameworks (when/how to raise prices)
• Conversion playbooks (landing page optimization)
• Retention sequences (reduce churn by 40%+)
• Upsell automations (increase LTV by 30%+)
• Acquisition strategies (SEO, affiliates, partnerships)

If you're serious about building a MicroSaaS business (not just a side project),
this framework will save you years of trial and error.

## Sequence 2: Educational Course (7-Day MicroSaaS Crash Course)

**Goal**: Deep education → Establish authority → Strong conversion
**Trigger**: User subscribes for "7-Day Course" or downloads advanced lead magnet
**Duration**: 7 days (1 email/day)

### Email 1: Course Intro + Day 1 Lesson
**Subject**: [Day 1/7] The MicroSaaS Mental Model
**Send**: Immediately after subscription

```
Hey [First Name],

Welcome to the 7-Day MicroSaaS Crash Course!

Over the next week, you'll learn:
• How to find validated ideas (not guesses)
• How to build MVPs in days (not months)
• How to launch to 1,000+ people (Product Hunt playbook)
• How to get your first 10 customers (repeatable system)
• How to scale to $10K MRR (the 5 levers)

Each email = one lesson. By day 7, you'll have everything you need to launch.

Let's start:

DAY 1: THE MICROSAAS MENTAL MODEL

What is MicroSaaS?
• Micro = Small, focused, niche
• SaaS = Software as a Service (recurring revenue)

Examples:
• Bannerbear (automated image generation) - $40K MRR
• Fathom Analytics (privacy-focused analytics) - $120K MRR
• Nomad List (digital nomad community) - $90K MRR

Common pattern: Solve ONE problem for ONE niche VERY well.

Not: "Project management for everyone"
Yes: "Project management for construction companies"

Why MicroSaaS vs traditional SaaS?

✅ Faster to build (weeks not years)
✅ Lower costs (no team needed)
✅ Easier to market (niche = specific channels)
✅ Better margins (solo = keep 100% of revenue)
✅ Less stress (small scale, big impact)

YOUR EXERCISE:
Think of 3 niches you understand deeply. Reply with your list.

Tomorrow: How to find pain points in those niches (the Reddit scraper method).

[Your Name]

Course Schedule:
✅ Day 1: Mental Model (today)
→ Day 2: Idea Discovery
→ Day 3: Validation
→ Day 4: Building MVPs
→ Day 5: Launch Strategy
→ Day 6: First Customers
→ Day 7: Scaling to $10K

### Email 2-7: Continue Course
**Note**: Each email follows same structure:
- Quick recap of previous lesson

- Exercise or homework
- Teaser for tomorrow

**Day 7 (Final Email)** includes strong CTA to purchase framework:

• 3 production templates (start at 80%)
• 38 AI agents (build 4x faster)
• Complete playbooks (proven strategies)
• Launch in 7 days (not months)

Time: 7-14 days per product
Success rate: ~85%

The framework is everything I taught you this week, but production-ready:
• 210+ files
• 50,000+ lines of code
• Built by autonomous AI agents
• Battle-tested through real launches

Investment: $497 (launch price, normally $997)
Risk: Zero (30-day money-back guarantee)

[BUTTON: Get HermeticSaaS - $497]

You've learned the strategy. Now get the system.

P.S. - You're 1 decision away from launching your first MicroSaaS.

### Email Copywriting Rules

3. **Body** (one main idea, easy to scan, conversational)
4. **CTA** (clear, specific, easy to find)
5. **Closing** (sign off with name, keep it human)
6. **P.S.** (use it! 90% of people read it)
