## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Week 1 Pitfalls
- ❌ Spending too long on landing page design (ship at 80%)
- ❌ Overthinking domain name (just pick one and move on)
- ❌ Not testing email sequences before launch
- ✅ Solution: Follow the daily checklist, don't deviate

### Week 3-6 Pitfalls (Building)
- ❌ Building features nobody asked for
- ❌ Perfectionism (not shipping until "perfect")
- ❌ Not talking to customers daily
- ✅ Solution: Interview 10 people BEFORE building, ship MVP in 14 days max

### Week 7-10 Pitfalls (Framework Launch)
- ❌ Launching without case study (need proof)
- ❌ Not having testimonials ready
- ❌ Underpricing out of fear ($997 is correct, don't go lower)
- ✅ Solution: Use MicroSaaS launch as proof, charge what it's worth

### General Pitfalls
- ❌ Not building in public (hiding until "perfect")
- ❌ Trying to do everything alone (not asking for help)
- ❌ Giving up after slow first week
- ✅ Solution: Tweet daily, join communities, be patient

## 💪 Mindset for Success

**Week 1-2**: Infrastructure feels slow. Trust the process.
**Week 3-6**: Building is hard. Ship before you're ready.
**Week 7**: Launch is scary. Do it anyway.
**Week 8-10**: Sales are slow at first. Keep showing up.
**Week 11-13**: Momentum builds. Double down on what works.

**Remember**:
- Done > Perfect
- Shipped beats stored
- Revenue cures all
- Your 1st customer won't be your last
- Every successful founder felt this way
